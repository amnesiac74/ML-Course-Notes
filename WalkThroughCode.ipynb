       "      <td>john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles    so effortlessly that people tend to forget he s there   much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors   anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor s face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors      example   the other day my mother asked me   the expert   of course   if there were any movies out worth seeing   never mind that our tastes couldn t be more divergent    i ll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes   and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go    was a lot of fun   which it is     so i didn t see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation    i muttered   with a little trepidation   that she might enjoy high fidelity    she responded with her usual query     whose in that one      this is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see    if the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light   a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing   and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people   usually of the jewish faith   fretting about in some upper east side palace    anyway   when i answered   john cusack     she replied with a rather stunned   who       as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to    now i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies   most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin   but i suppose it s understandable that she would not recognize the name   after all   for most   names are tougher than faces    i showed her a picture of cusack s mug in the paper hoping for an   oh   him   yes he s quite good   instead i got a   no   i don t know him      at this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger   yes   filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone     till i realized something   i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack s relatively bland visage   or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise   one syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car    cu sack   cu sack   no   not quite as cool    i m sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as   the guy from   add in the cusack film of your choice        he s not a brand name   and his movies usually aren t big moneymakers   but in his own unassuming way he s kind of a genius    with his pleasant   common man looks   and charming semi articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90 s    from the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon    despite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it   the schlumpy every man     he s a constantly enjoyable screen persona   like albert brooks or woody allen    and he knows how to chose scripts   while the stephan baldwin s and val kilmer s seem to put them selves in everything   the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle   and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent     cusack generally picks rewarding projects   save for the unwatchable hot pursuit   a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller      high fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears   the grifters   the hi lo country     and it s a hit    it was also co written by cusack   and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy   grosse point blank    it s not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film   but as it progresses in its meandering fashion   the movie cast something of a spell over me    high fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non committal rob   a vinyl record store owner   who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his   top 5 break ups list      this is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller s day off    at first the talking directly into the camera schtick had me vaguely annoyed   mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit   but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack s witty delivery    he s the kind of guy we don t mind talking directly to us    gradually the film settles into a shampoo like tragi comic character study   of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is   yes it s all very existential      though that plot line is mostly enjoyable   the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters   all of whom   now this is really something   are terrific enough to warrant their own films    the best of which is jack black   of the very funny show tenacious d   a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis  hair       unfortunately that annoying smirk remains     an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy    he s the kind of guy i m sure we ve all met before   a blowhard who thinks he s always right and will do anything in his power   be it yell   argue   insult   to hoist his opinion onto others    but i like this guy   because of how black plays him    the actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes   but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak   which might be a bit of a redundant description   seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic      he s the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films       look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister      but fears and black never let that happen    the character   for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality    he s over the top   but in a way we can all probably relate to    catherine zeta jones   in her brief role   gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own   charm      tim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age type   a character played entirely for cartoon yuks   but still manages to work its desired comic effect    the one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy   the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle   mifune     who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent   replacing it with a stilted american phonation    i give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role   but instead of being likeable   she comes across as rather robotic   and as such it s hard to see why cusack s character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful   intelligent writer   natasha gregson wagner   potentially waiting in the wings    this reminded me of say anything   where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye   and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood   whose unbelievably more wooden then father   clint for those   special people   whose wheels turn a little slower      in fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his   though i d bet that if laura and natasha switched roles   the result would be more effective    high fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances    fears  direction is somewhat stilted   and the script is sometimes a little too   and this is a word i m beginning to hate to use but alas i must   quirky for its own good   i think i ll blame that on scott rosenberg   who judging from what he did with beautiful girls   con air   and things to do in denver while your dead   has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie      but cusack really does deserve an award   for being so damn       cusackian    i m afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent    his character   rob   whose sort of like an older   more bitter lloyd from say anything   is funny and tragic without being pathetic   and that cusack can do all this   and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences   is something of an achievement</td>\n",

       "      <td>first rule of fight club is   don t talk about fight club      this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film   because quite frankly   it s not even worth mentioning    director david fincher   seven   has completely gone over the edge    with crude humor   an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture   i m surprised i didn t walk out    this just goes to show that hype kills    it s very rare that a film so hyped up as   fight club   turns out to be noteworthy   and this is no exception    the story goes like this    edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions   until he meets marla   helena bonham carter      norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle   when he spots her at a session that he also attended    apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like   literally living in pain    why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me   but things do get worse    norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling   and it s on a plane that he meets tyler durden   brad pitt      the two men develop a bond   and go out to a bar   and by golly after they get drunk   the two pitiful characters fight    how do they come up with this stuff    anyway   their fighting catches other pathetic loser s attention   and a club is formed    out of all this mess   there manages to lie a message    fincher shows us that society is like robots    we work in our jobs doing things step by step   and want out    our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are   and we blame it on others    call me crazy   but this is common knowledge    i think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is   which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably    even with two good actors   and a solid actress   they only manage to weaken the story    i couldn t help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp    it just shows how desperate the script is for attention    i guess brad pitt was right for this role   because i felt like beating him up myself    his bothersome and depressing character   made me disgusted at his 20 million fee    it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more    helena bonham carter however really had no purpose    she just popped up on screen   mumbled some lines   smoked and left    this continues for what seems like 6 hours    the film drags on and my headache gets bigger   while   fight club   nears what i think might be the end    unfortunately by then   the film hits rock bottom    though the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes   it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace    on a side note   the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film   that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer    fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson    concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment   won t do any good if everything else is in need of support    also   i m afraid that immature men might respond to the film s violence    the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult    when the film ends   i m just glad to get home and take some advil    you ll either enjoy what the film has to offer   or agree with ed norton when he says   this is so f       ing stupid</td>\n",

       "      <td>note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    james toback s return to directing after a eight year layoff   two girls and a guy   is a film which is comprised   more or less   of just that   one guy   blake   robert downey jr       two girls   carla   heather graham   and lou   natasha gregson wagner     one primary setting   blake s absurdly spacious bachelor apartment     and a great deal of dialogue    embracing a near real time approach   this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr   toback for his bantering characters    fortunately   the film s cast is up to the challenge   and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters   while admittedly variable   are occasionally wickedly amusing    the film s setup is fairly generic in nature   and opens rather unpromisingly    we meet self possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou   both waiting outside a soho loft    as they engage in idle chatter   it is revealed that they re both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport   and it doesn t take long for them to come to the realisation that they re being two timed by the same guy    more indignant with him than catty with each other   the duo break into blake s loft and await his arrival for a confrontation    it s when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride    played with magnificent bombast by mr   downey jr     blake is a cad   all right   but a captivatingly dynamic   blusterous   and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights    it s fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat   and perhaps the film s best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return   allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others   but by his own innate behaviour    whether he s flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi   or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds   carla   lou   and his unseen sickly mother     it s never less than wildly entertaining and insightful    though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one man show    a typical afternoon in the life of blake   if you will    carla   and then lou   reveal themselves   and the sparks begin to fly       one of the great touches in the film is how blake   when startled by carla s unannounced appearance   begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat s out of the bag      double teamed by the understandably aggrieved women   who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful    they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy     an increasingly flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self righteous declarations against their verbal jabs    surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters   two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off limits for this film    however   it d be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou s outrage to full feature length   and it s as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel    the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever   the film s tempo loses its liveliness   the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion   and several sequences fall flat    subtle and not quite subtle allusions are made   a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall     and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale    one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla    two girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter   long running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene    contractually obligated to deliver an r rated film   mr   toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc 17 rating in favour of an r    and while admittedly titillating   the net effect of the vignette on the film s thematic narrative is rather dubious    if anything   two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr   downey jr     whose versatility is put to the test in this film    he plays the gamut from indignant to humbled   from self assured to disconcerted   yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered    it s a wonderful performance in a role custom tailored for him   mr   toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr   downey jr   was arrested on drug charges   and it s hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character    in a monologue to his mirrored reflection   blake s self chiding to   get  his  shit together   is disquieting in its resonance    while mr   downey jr    s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film   both actresses are solid in more broadly observed roles    ms   graham is quickly becoming one of america s more daring actresses   involving herself in three successive risky projects    two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank   while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman    she s quite appealing here   playing a character at once both dainty and sultry    meanwhile   ms   gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying   or   like me   endearing    she tones it down substantially as the film progresses   but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox    the film was reportedly shot in eleven days   filmed mostly in sequence   and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout    two girls and a guy has an agile   spontaneous sort of feel   and one senses that mr   toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors    while the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact   it doesn t feel constricted   the expansive apartment setting is well used to vary the background   and mr   toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner    two girls and a guy falls short of its potential   but thanks to some stellar work by mr   downey jr     it s still often an enjoyable   bitingly funny romp   particularly as we watch the surprisingly resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends       i m an actor     he tells them at one point   using the ol  tried and tested occupational hazard defense       actors lie      but not   they all seem to agree   denzel washington</td>\n",

       "      <td>the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes   and the greedy trade federation has used it s armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo    we soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboo s ruler   the young queen amidala   natalie portman   to sign a treaty giving the federation control    however   the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui gon jinn   liam neeson   and obi wan kenobi   ewan mcgregor   as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade    no sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi   and the first battle begins    it seems that for me and thousands of people like me   the love for george lucas s trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time    we re the fans   not the freaks    we won t go dressing up like darth vader   although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool     and we won t incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations   not all the time   anyway     but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest   we re throwing down    all right   stop looking at me like that    we have been faithfully and patiently waiting    waiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll    you see   the trilogy is not just a set of movies   but a religion of sorts to we   the faithful disciples   and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah    unfortunately   it is not our savior    for weeks beforehand   i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good   stupendously good   miraculously good    anything less and it ll be the biggest disappointment of the century    i didn t want the doomsaying prophecy to come true   really i didn t   but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking    character development is virtually nonexistent    with the possible exception of qui gon   most of the film s characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions    none seem very affected by their experiences   and few even show any passion at all    contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks   a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo   in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala    jar jar s life is saved by qui gon early in the film   and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh   or supposedly so      his speech mannerisms are so   cute ified   that i couldn t understand a third of what he was saying   and the slapstick he performed was just distracting    his head gets caught in an electronic field   his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast   he describes being in trouble as   deep doo doo     and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport    therein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors    in star wars   we had obi wan telling us mos eisley was a   wretched hive of scum and villainy      in the phantom menace   we get doo doo    the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story   a long time ago in a galaxy far   far away            this film   on the other hand   constantly reminds me that it s only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience    perhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition   it s kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses     and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500 like play by play    i liked the pod race   it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension   but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters    the race would have been even more exciting without the distraction    this aspect   coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me    i suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer   but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all    didn t millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again    didn t the action figures still sell like hotcakes    of course they did   and it s only poor judgment that allows the most eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults    one aspect that will appeal broadly   however   is the use of special effects    the people at lucas s industrial light and magic   the world s premiere effects house   outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer generated images and real life footage    some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed   especially the shots of a land battle between the federation s robot army and jar jar s countrymen    the space battles are also impressive   although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer    this   however   is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today    john williams is back   of course   providing a score for the film as only he can    his music is pervasive throughout   as rousing and as dramatic as ever   always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately    since this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine episode story   star wars   the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four   five and six   respectively     the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already   in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar    as a result   attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin    it would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obi wan   for example   but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover   it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films    one of the new characters is darth maul   hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film s release    in spite of the hype   darth maul is a character which almost didn t have to be in the film   his role is so insignificant    he has maybe three spoken lines   believe it or not   a second actor voices the character   and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean    with that working against him   he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment    lucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe   something which has been prominent throughout    however   he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible   offering an easy out for story writing and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a real life connection    oddly   while trying to capitalize on spirituality   lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little force loving parasites in your body s cells    this only serves to de mystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection    don t let me mislead you too far    the phantom menace   by most standards   is a good film    it contains a lot of visual treats   sets the stage for an epic story   gives us a bit of excitement here and there   and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends    it s just that when held up to it s predecessors   and to not do so would be unrealistic     this film simply pales</td>\n",

the way back to the early talkies   and maybe even to the first pictures   albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future    no such thing will happen to bruno   whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi landmark feature   while bruno may have studied under cameron s wing for years and years   i m beginning to wonder at what capacity   and what exactly did he learn from him    in fact     virus   should at least be mediocre   the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron   a director who   if anything   just knows how to make a movie   and then make a film like   virus   is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z grade schlockfest of a film   albeit a z grade schlockfest with a respectable budget    the film seems to not only borrow it s plot from last year s similarly fated   deep rising     but also from a clunkish b movie from the  80s called   leviathan     an underwater thriller starring peter weller   richard crenna   hector elizando   and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part   alien     part john carpenter s twisted remake of   the thing         virus     again   has a similar   uh   selling point   a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water    they get on    they break up into pairs and investigate    and they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy   has taken over all the machines on board   have meshed the machines with parts from corpses   and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary   ha ha      not that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving   not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond ian opening   the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir     destroying any of the suspense in what could happen   but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters    of its motley crew   it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper   a masculine potential romantic interest   a drunken captain   a black technician   a tatooed aborigine   a manic russian survivor   and a couple other candidates for alien food   none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin   plain piece of writing paper    and it s not the traditional argument for films like these   where you may in fact want them all to be eaten   even   aliens   played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers   but this was more of a plus side for the film as a whole than the opposite     instead   as another cliche goes   you just don t give a damn    i almost don t even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub par to horrific   the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is   and she is   just not really here   and the latter being   and it pains me to say this as he s a particular favorite of mine   donald sutherland   who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance of which he should be ashamed    like anthony hopkins for   legends of the fall     the line   scrooooooo  em   has been thus embroidered upon my membrance      or peter o toole in   caligula      great actor   horrific performance    it happens every now and then   and it only helps sutherland s career that no one   except for an elite few   even bothered to see this film    though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years   waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can   read   early january   when everyone s still trying to catch up on the potential oscar nominees     it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film   it s laden with complex machinery   boasts respectable production design   and it may even feature believable special effects       if   of course   i   or anyone else   could see them       virus   mostly takes place on a large   abandoned cruiser   and mostly at night until the dawn   and mostly without the use of lights   not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey   but more so because   as the hollywood cliche seems to go     if it s dark enough   then the special effects will be more believable      and if you don t believe me   go back and rent   godzilla     and tell me if there s even one shot where we see godzilla either a   in his entirety in one wide shot   or b   n the light so that we can at least see him   well   you don t really have to sit through it again   just take my word for it      but all of this doesn t matter since   virus   is basically just one loud   cluttered mess of a movie    the action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i ve ever seen   my   um   favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship   during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves   rain   and any other ocean extremeties the film can cook up   then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned   well   i must say   thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn t figure it out when i saw it      imagine the first attack of the aliens in   aliens     shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity   and that s basically the whole of   virus     one horribly directed action scene after the other   capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members    and my god   it s a long damn sit    with no interesting characters   no dramatic urgency   no tension   not one good moment of action   and no mesmerizing visuals   it s a wonder that it even got made    we already know that big movie studios  mentality is shallow at best   and movies like   out of sight   and   saving private ryan   give you more faith in them   but movies like   virus   manage to drain a little more out of the pool    i almost wish that instead of making this movie   john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light    they read the script   they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack   and he is     and they still went ahead with the project   only to have bruno and company shit back in their face    even though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie   i d say even more contempt should be aimed at mr   bruno for making a movie that could be this bad    in fact   shouts of   egad   man   what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway      are not only justifiable   but encouraged</td>\n",

       "      <td>let s say you live at the end of an airport runway    large jetliners continuously pass over your house   rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace    let s say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances   and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home    now let s say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway   and offers you more than it s worth    wouldn t you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed    of course you would    but what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise   and the house your castle    that s what they are to darryl kerrigan   michael caton     and although he s happy that a multi national corporation would like to buy his home   sorry   it s not for sale    unfortunately   the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government   which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice    not about to take this lying down   darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto   tiriel mora   and makes a determined   albeit pathetic   attempt to fight back    the castle   an australian comedy by rob sitch   is perhaps one of the simplest movies i ve seen in recent memory   yet also one of the funniest    in fact   it is this film s reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful    the good guys and the bad guys are clear   the humor is straightforward   and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets    it s the perfect setup for a relaxing   hilarious good time   and as much as i hate to admit it   i liked the fact that i didn t have to think all that much while watching this film    i just sat back and enjoyed myself    the situation is one we ve seen before   regular joe fights back against the government   or big business   or whatever    what makes this film different is its characters    darryl thinks he s got the best life in the world   he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind   he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he s got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal   anne tenny     and he swells with pride when his son dale   stephen curry   digs a hole in the yard    steve kerrigan   anthony simcoe   constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for   investments   like jousting sticks and overhead projectors   while wayne kerrigan is in jail   as a result of dennis denuto s incompetent courtroom maneuvers    the great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren t so stupid that they get annoying    they re just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing    we look upon them with a little bit of pity   but a whole lot of affection    screenwriters sitch   santo cilauro   tom gleisner   and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate   further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans    sympathy for their situation   the laughter they bring us   and the family s wonderful characterization   simple as it may be   leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them    i suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans   but trust me   it works    i particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs    don t get me wrong   slapstick   when executed well   can be genius    it s just that too often   a film will resort to it s use as a shortcut to amusing the audience   not always successfully    instead   the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world    when they are by themselves   the are funny   and when they are with normal people   they are hilarious    one of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though    the kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film s running time    luckily   it s a funny little detour that   while slightly distracting from the film s main drive   is still quite enjoyable    with all the levity abound in the castle   the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept   that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property   an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes    i m not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life   but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution   of australia   and certainly sounds impressive at any rate    and   for that matter   it s more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this</td>\n",

       "      <td>earth is a harsh   unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent    people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict   as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets   indian and pakistani   muslim   hindu   sikh   parsee    the story takes place in lahore   which was indian before partition   and pakistani afterward   regardless of what its citizens might call themselves    the action is seen through the eyes of lenny   maaia sethna     a young parsee girl   but it is really about her nanny   shanta    shanta has a small circle of male admirers    two of the men are suitors   hasan   rahul khanna     a hindu   and dil navaz   aamir khan     a muslim    the others  sikh   hindu   muslim  are older   some are married   but all appreciate shanta   who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das       she also starred in deepa mehta s previous film   fire   the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water      in an early scene   the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny   political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears    one of the men remarks   jokingly   that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along    he is wrong   the men make barbed little comments to each other   spoken like jokes   but with an undercurrent of fanaticism    the tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses    it is easy to perceive   in these squabbles   the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter    the group around shanta represents   in a sense   a united india   and shanta herself the ideal motherland  one which all love   which inspires hindu   muslim   and sikh to live peacably together    but the circle around shanta is sundered   as is the state    a sikh is persecuted   hides   then flees    another man is murdered    the group of friends will not meet again    the movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction   a plate shattered on the floor   a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child   and   most brutally   when the tension escalates into violence   a man is held down   tied between two cars   and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles    it is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully    the crux of earth s plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz    his sisters are killed in brutal fashion   by hindus   because they are muslim    dil navaz seeks solace from shanta   and asks in desperation that she marry him    but she loves hasan   and tenderly refuses dil navaz s offer    the combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him   and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality   the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate    despite the things he later does   it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him   but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things    the conclusion  the consequence of dil navaz s transformation  is rather abrupt    the story earth tells does not end    it just stops    it is an appropriate finish   giving us closure would have imparted   at least on an aesthetic level   a sense of resolution   of satisfaction    but there was no resolution for india and pakistan  they have been at war   on a small or large scale   for decades    since the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation   it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus    there is no healing to be had   no closure   on any level   despite the needless   tacked on ending   with voice over narration from lenny as an adult   framing the story      earth is   in some ways   an unexceptional movie    it does not reinvent the wheel   following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas    but deepa mehta s directon is assured   and the issues she addresses run deep    earth does for india what movies like zhang yimou s to live and tian zhuangzhuang s the blue kite did for china   they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history    such films strike me as inherently valuable   even when flawed    they may be biased or inaccurate   but they bear the weight of human hardship   and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other   more inventive films   often lack    it is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries   the events shown may have happened decades ago   but they still touch a nerve    the issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year    in the near future   india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other    at the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen   after seeing earth   i have a much   much better understanding</td>\n",

       "      <td>my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love    i love ralph fiennes    i love uma thurman    i love sean connery    hell   i m even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw    i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago   and i ve been eagerly awaiting the film ever since    a few months into the summer   however   i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times   and that it had ended up in the mid august dumping ground    then   in this final week before its official release   i learned that it was not to be screened for critics    and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs    and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique    my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things    the film i saw today didn t even meet those expectations    this is a lousy   incoherent mess    i would slam it harder   if it weren t for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine   lovable actors    but sets are ultimately empty   and the performances are completely uninspired    that s the main problem with the avengers   for all it s hip hop flash and tidal waves   none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired    it s like a chore   a bland exercise in superhero film making    it also feels like its been cut to pieces   clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots    this is just plain depressing    the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show    frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i ve never watched an episode    i wasn t alive then    i don t even watch television now    i m very sorry that i don t have this perspective   but   judging from the reviews i ve already read   knowing the tv show just makes matters worse    i didn t know and love john steed and emma peel   and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles    i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film    based on what the film told me   i gather that steed   fiennes   is some kind of british super guy   somewhat like james bond     and that dr   peel   thurman   is just a really smart doctor   who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits    they are to work together   under mother s orders   mother is played by jolly jim broadbent   while his co conspirator   father   is played by the equally talented fiona shaw      it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather    his name is de wynter   connery      he is a crazy scottish guy    our heroes had better stop him   or else            the weather will keep getting colder until they   have to go to hell to warm up     one of the film s few funny lines      along the way there is subplot after subplot   hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere   feel perfunctory   and ultimately make no sense    for example   our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos    now   killer bugs don t really go with the weather controlling theme of the film    the purpose of the bugs   other than to annihilate our heroes   is never established    they re never even directly connected to de wynter   they re controlled by his crazy henchman   played by eddie izzard      the special effects aren t bad   but they re loud   obnoxious   and intrusive    like so many scenes in the film   it seems present only to keep your attention from waning    and i guarantee you   it will wane    i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn t do any good to think    the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn t tell us what happens    there are several scenes in the preview that didn t make the final cut    in addition   many of the sequences have irritating   grainy film quality   which makes it feel low budget   the last scene is particularly bad      the scenes that don t feature action should be electric   thanks to our wonderful cast    they aren t    the action scenes should be electric   because this is an action film    they aren t   either    and what about this wasted cast    oh   it makes me weep with disappointment    we re talking ralph fiennes here   one of the best actors working today   one of the best actors   ever      i love the guy    i ve loved all his films   until this one    he seems like he wants to understand the film   but he s as lost as we are    and thurman   in all of her spectacular beauty and talent   can t manage to look at home here       i don t blame her completely   for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way   and it can t be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting      connery   however   seems the most out of it   totally lacking any kind of focus   or interest   for that matter    who is to blame    is it the screenwriter   don macpherson    perhaps   although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right    is it the actors    for god s sake   no    these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling    i blame director jeremiah chechik   who shouldn t have been given the task to begin with    his best film   benny   joon   is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be   but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor    add to that a lack of experience in big budget action   and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory    if the avengers has a saving grace   it s the set design    the sets   by stuart craig   are big   colorful   and often pleasing to look at    i like the final set piece   on de wynter s island   even if none of it makes a bit of sense    i admired the overhead view of the stairs   showing dr   peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere    i also enjoyed michael kamen s music score   particularly in the opening credits    but this stuff is routine    good sets and music are nice   but there s a lot more that needs to be here    inspiration   for instance   would have been really nice    maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story    or a sense of purpose    most of all   though   i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles    damn this movie for not giving them the chance</td>\n",

shy       are rarely ever written as real people   but merely as one dimensional caricatures    when an added layer to one of their personalities is revealed   it is not to service the character development   or to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations   but to accommodate the convoluted plot    in a lightweight comedy   you might say   it is not required to have perfectly realized figures   just as long as they get the job done    unfortunately   for a comedy to work   it has to at least succeed at being funny   and if there was a laugh o meter available   i d guess that it briefly ascended around 2   5  of the time for me    suffice to say   the comedy in   the whole nine yards   works about as well as the broken down lawnmower in my backyard   and when a giggle surprisingly arises every twenty to thirty minutes   it is by sheer luck    nicholas   oz   oseransky   matthew perry   is an amateur dentist living in the quiet suburbs of quebec    trapped in a hateful marriage with the conniving sophie   rosanna arquette   delightfully hamming it up with a clearly artificial french canadian accent     one day oz sees that someone is moving into the house next door    walking over to greet him   he is horrified to discover it is jimmy   the tulip   tudeski   bruce willis     a former contract killer for the mafia who has just been released from prison    once getting to know him and becoming his friend   oz is more comfortable with his identity   but for sophie   it means a possible hitman to do away with oz    in her scheme   sophie sends oz to chicago to cash in by informing his old mob boss   kevin pollak   about jimmy s whereabouts   but in the process   he falls in love with jimmy s wife   cynthia   natasha henstridge     who is being held hostage    upon return to quebec   and with one contrivance after the next   oz s dental assistant   jill   amanda peet     is overjoyed to discover that he lives beside   the tulip     and forces him to set up a meeting   since jill s dream in life turns out being a contract killer herself    have you got all that    because there is more    much   much more    and this is a movie that   without credits   is little over 90 minutes and feels only like an hour       the whole nine yards   is an ultimately unsatisfying and empty headed excursion into well worn terrain already set by far superior pictures    how the cast   most of which are respectable actors   got caught up in such a cliched   deficient film remains a mystery   unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynn s 1985 comedy classic     clue   the movie      going into the theater   preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable   but by the twenty minute mark   when i had chuckled once and laughed nary a single time   it was clear this production was in serious trouble    since the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot   and the screenplay   inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner   collapses with every failing   comedy   bit   the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance and   frequently   entertainment value       the whole nine yards   is neither facetious nor   aside from the subplot about jill s shocking eagerness to become a professional hitwoman   inventive   and more often than not   just lies there   the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector   but never igniting any sort of spark    a few select actors do what they can with the material   while others make no impact at all    on the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters   matthew perry and bruce willis    perry   innocuously enjoyable on tv s   friends     plays the same exact sitcom style character in all of his movies   from 1997 s   fools rush in   to 1999 s   three to tango       and it has become a crushing bore    meanwhile   willis makes next to no impression   and because of the limited guise of his jimmy   the tulip   tudeski   oftentimes disappears into the background    their three female counterparts fare noticeably better    best of all is natasha henstridge   far more radiant than in the exploitative   species   movies   who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to cynthia    henstridge has the talent   for sure   to break out of these countless throwaway roles   but first she must fire her agent    amanda peet has a lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward and giddy jill   and seems to know more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who   thus far   has strived on a career based solely on comedy    it is too bad   then   that peet is unnecessarily asked to disrobe in a climactic scene   with the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts    finally   rosanna arquette is awful as sophie   but something tells me that was her purpose   and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time    also popping up is michael clarke duncan   fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in   the green mile     as jimmy s largely built friend and fellow killer   frankie figs    when   the whole nine yards   eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion   one is left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit    a great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past   and this one is nothing but a duplication of better films   so what was the point    without a passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments     the whole nine yards   rests solely on the presumed charm of the cast   and half of the actors are not charming at all    now   what does that tell you</td>\n",

       "      <td>actually   i m fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie       baywatch   babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her double d s on the small screen    at least there you don t have to pay to see her cleavage    and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless   hate to burst your bubble   but there are no full fledged nude scenes in barb wire    you wouldn t be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in    i can t go back in time and reverse my mistake   but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there    they do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude   it s so quick you can t even tell for sure whether you re seeing her andersons or not    a nipple hallucination sort of thing    barb wire was adapted from a comic book   interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life   even wearing low cut leather to do office work   businesswoman bondage wear   and having unreal body proportions    yes   like the mona lisa   pamela anderson is a man made beauty   probably in more senses than one    she is a definite beauty   though   and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience    you d just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldn t have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie   because it s obvious she wasn t pulling a sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills    i mean   she shows off more cleavage here than a jeweler s convention    the movie is set in the year 2017     the worst year of my life     pam says         the worst movie of the year     i say      america is going through a second civil war and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation   silicone valley   i think      she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right   posing as first a stripper and later as a prostitute    but don t call her   babe      she hates that   and reminds us of that fact way too many times    imagine   a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar while having a hose sprayed on her being referred to in such a sexist   demeaning term    a liberated woman like pamela anderson shouldn t have to hear words like   babe   during a strip tease   especially since that movie about the talking pig was such a success    the plot   ha ha   revolves around a pair of contact lenses that allow their wearer to pass through the congressional directorate s retina scanners    in the words of one of the characters   they re   more than meets the eye      reminds me of the   transformers   cartoon   and i sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent   but that never happened    no   the movie just continued on its path of lame action scenes starring pamela van damme   big busted kickboxer   and her resistance accomplices   ex boyfriend axel   tamuera morrison   and cora   victoria rowell      thank god they didn t name her cora reef    one bad character name is more than enough    pamela originally doesn t take sides   giving some speech about she s only loyal to the money they pay her   but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother   jack noseworthy of bon jovi   always   video fame    i still don t know if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy   but he definitely is nose worthy   even if he isn t sponge worthy      pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semi automatic weapons and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest    it s not rambo        it s bimbo    mark my words   barb wire will be all over the cinemax network in a year    it s got all the elements of the direct to video releases featured on hbo s bastard cousin   the cable channel i d never watch if it didn t somehow come free    it s got the non titillating scenes of voyeurism   laughable flashbacks   bad dialogue and action cliches out the wazzoo    there s even a narrator at the beginning setting up the movie s premise while the words scroll up the screen    someone needs to tell pamela the wookie this ain t star wars    if you ve seen any action flick of the past fifteen years   you ll recognize plenty of lifted elements    barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over   car crashes   explosions   broken glass and slow motion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet to their death    this is one of those automatic pilot movies anyone could write or direct    barb wire has only two things going for it        and i think you know what those two things are</td>\n",

the movie s   outer space     the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home    yes   in terms of acting   the star power is            well   more like a falling star    kinda pretty   short lived   and pretty much dead    lost in space   as if you really didn t know   is based on the 60 s sci fi television series of the same name    it s the year 2058   and earth s precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population    john robinson   william hurt   is the scientist leading a mission program to colonize a foreign planet    earth s entire existance is contingent upon a successful mission   but nobody   whether it be john s family or hired battle pilot don west   matt leblanc     seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years    john s family consists of his wife maureen   mimi rogers     his atypical teenage daughter penny   lacey chabert     his ingenious son will   jack johnson     and his beautiful scientist daughter judy   heather graham      despite everyone s reluctance   the jupiter 2 spacecraft abandons planet earth and makes its way into the vast eternity of space    unknown to anyone but the audience   there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage the entire mission    dr   smith   gary oldman   has been hired by a group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour   and dr   smith has re programmed a talking robot to   destroy robinson family      when everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides   the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination   and now the premise of being lost in space is complete    as for the audience   you will likely be lost in boredom by this point   wondering if the plot   like the jupiter 2   will ever get off the ground    it s hard to tell who deserves the most blame   the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script    chabert is basically the only one to overdo it   sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium    if you   like me   were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens   you re wrong    that s just her normal voice    in yet another example of a   friend   faltering on the big screen   leblanc is so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming   make sense       it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod    graham is a babe   thank goodness there was something for me to think about during this film    hurt   the black hole of excitement   sucks up any energy that might have been left    if hurt were available in tablet form   he would be a prescription strength sleeping pill    johnson isn t dull   he s just lame as the young know it all who winds up saving everybody s ass all the time    want an example of how cool this kid can be    how about when he convinces the robot to think with its heart and reconsider killing the family    hey   don t laugh   the thing actually listened to the mr   rogers would be proud sentiment    but alas   if you thought a character couldn t be much worse   there was rogers as the epitome of generic   or   mother as she was known      why hire an actress    they could ve had a white cardboard cutout with the word mom printed on it    now that would ve had some pizzazz    lost in space luckily doesn t suffer in every single category that it could have    the special effects are crisp   clear   and at least mildly captivating   unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman   who plays his evil character with a great deal of fun and finesse    unfortunately   oldman is locked away for most of the film   giving us nothing but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy    while the special effects are pleasing to the eye   they are nothing you couldn t find in most modern sci fi films    contact   for example   far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination    lost in space just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work of cinematic art   with numerous contradictions   the time travel aspect was horribly flawed       wooden and corny acting   worse dialogue   and an ending so disappointing   you d be happier to have seen the entire robinson family get blown to smithereens    then again   with an ending like this film has   it s obvious a sequel is already being considered    what an awful note to end on   knowing there could be more of this in a year or two    the attempt to be family oriented is commendable   but lost in space is lost with the illusion that special effects and the nostalgia of a classic tv series being revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups    well   danger potential movie goers    danger    this movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity</td>\n",

gave the film a resonation it might not of had   and though its kill or be killed approach to business was exaggerated   that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan era businessman    stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs   evil tale relayed in the fast paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange    critics and audiences lauded wall street   elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic    i m proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them    i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone s output with its thin caricatures   obvious sentiments   and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen    stone goes for broke in every scene   the same could be said for nearly all of his works      this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions    he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane    it s all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity   rather than explore what these situations are really like    i have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative   as they are presented in boiler room   rather than laughably over the top    these guys are salesmen after all   not televised judges    more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street    the only possible solution i can muster is its release date    and not just the timeliness of the   greed is good   subject matter   the film was plumped down in the eighties   a decade in which the one joke comedy rose to an art form   and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept   low result movies    in my mind   the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies   but bad music   bad hair   and bad clothes    maybe stone s after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace    boiler room is an equally well timed film with some similarities to stone s piece of crap    they both feature a consequential father son relationship   though boiler room s is much more subtle and touching    and they are both concerned with the power of greed   yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery smooth   heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street    boiler room is a message movie as well   though   at least until the end   doesn t shove it in our faces    boiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash    as i said   this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day   bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn t been seen in quite a while     not only do we want to be millionaires   we want to watch other people become millionaires    in our super judgmental   power oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything   when you have money   you have it   all      and seth   giovanni ribisi   wants it   all   the easy way    he s a well intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm   the kind that sells junk stock   whereupon he meets others just like him    ben affleck is cast as jim   the company headhunter   who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko    his job is to influence trainee s into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood    it s ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b   s that they re told to dish out to prospective buyers    affleck s character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin s similar character in glengary glen ross   and that proves detrimental to the actor s performance    affleck shouts   curses and be littles his rookie employees just like baldwin   minus the edge    when alec played the scene he became the part   spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own    by comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading    the brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks   they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game    rap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are   intellectual gangsters    they aren t above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes    we drink up this world along with seth   and watch him become seduced by it   just like we might be    as in all cautionary tales   boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing   then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness    i know this story    we all do    but it can work if it s told with intelligence and energy   and that is how writer   director ben younger tells it    as a director of   please excuse my french   mise en scene younger has much to learn    his style is sitcom bland    but his writing isn t    younger s script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch   his dialogue is like a junior david mamet    despite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script    the brokers   hucksters counter every customer objection   gently bullying them into buying stock    these moments are filmed like psychological action scenes   a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isn t aware that he is one    with the exception of affleck s brief appearances   the performances are truly exceptional    ribisi   who has the edgy looks of a character actor   is extremely potent here   working his pale angular face   and eerie   plaintive stare for all their worth    he conveys child like vulnerability   his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things aren t going his way   in some scenes   and in others he s ferociously cut throat    the jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie   ribisi is confident when it s just him and the phone   but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father   authoritatively played by ron rifkin      boiler room thankfully avoids wall street like histrionics in the sales pitch sequences   the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys    those ploys are taught to seth by chris   vin diesel     a kind broker who alternates between seth s friend and his mentor    diesl shines in his minor role    this week i saw the sci fi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner    in that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80 s   and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 70 s    nicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he can t have    nia long   as the firm s secretary     a lone black women amongst many white men   is ribisi s love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets   but develops into something more interesting    the two make an oddly likeable couple    long is smart and brash   and ribisi is charmingly aloof    at one point he says to her   i m just lookin  for some chocolate love      it s a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child like way   it becomes sweetly endearing    unfortunately   towards the end   the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy    there is much crying   hugging   and sorrowful stares    this is okay when taken in small doses   but younger s conclusion is constructed as a series of these boo hoo moments   one following the other    a particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seth s manipulations have on one of his poor victims    it s not a bad idea but the execution is lacking   with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message    that message being     greed is bad      yes it s patently obvious   but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i haven t seen much of in the movies   the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur    and all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners    boiler room offers neither extreme    it gives us what is in between   and for that i am thankful</td>\n",

       "      <td>david cronenberg presents us with another strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head    it is one of many science fiction films   released during the last year of this millenium   that tackles issues that will play an important role in our future    the story unfolds in a near future   where the line between reality and virtual reality blurs    the world of the future is an unfriendly place   where the scared inhabitants are   hiding   in virtual reality fantasy games to escape the uncertainty of the real world    allegra geller   jennifer jason leigh     the leading game designer in the world   is testing her new virtual reality game   existenz with a focus group    as they begin   she is attacked by a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun    she flees with a young marketing trainee   ted pikul   jude law     who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard    unfortunately   her pod   an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the existenz game program   is damaged    to inspect it   she talks ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game with her    the events leading up to this   and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesn t exist   as the   players   are forced to perform as characters in an unknown plot    here the reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their own or the game s perspective    i don t intend to reveal more of the film s premise   which is structured as a computer game   with   tasks   that the characters must complete to win the game    released after   the matrix   and   dark city       existenz   has some similarities and parallels that connect it to these films    however     existenz   is moving in a different direction   with a premise of its own    a combination of dazzling special effects   brilliantly coordinated action sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot   made   the matrix   a rare and entertaining science fiction experience   with some dark and frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade       existenz   has a completely different atmosphere   resembling   dark city     which is darker   more serious and less entertaining       existenz   has the opportunities and potential   but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored    after the engaging beginning   it starts to falter    while i was watching the film   many left the theatre during the first hour    and indeed     existenz   seemed as a complete failure   the actors seemed unreal   the plot and dialogue silly   unfinished relationships and unexplained events followed one after another    but the last fifteen minutes lifted the film on a complete different level   explaining all past events   the silly dialogue and the unreal performances within a few scenes    and jet the film fails on several issues    probably the best written character in the story is a game designer   who would rather spend the rest of her life in a virtual world   than face real life    this is a great possibility to create a magnificent character   and jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenberg s script to the limits   but fails because the advantages of virtual reality in comparison to the real world are never shown    existenz is not a world of which you might dream about in your fantasies    it is not a world worth sacrificing your life for    it s a cold   dark place where the   players   are forced to interrelate with unreal characters   eat mutated creatures and even murder against their own will    it doesn t look like a place worth even thinking about    david cronenberg has been the creator of   the fly       videodrome   and   the dead zone     so it s not so hard to guess that   existenz   is a violent and gory film    besides the regular murders of innocent people   the audiences can enjoy an autopsy of a two headed mutated amfibium    scenes like that have become a trademark for cronenberg and it seems that he can t make a film without flowing blood and foul creatures    the way i see it   this is the film s crucial failure    it is impossible for cronenbergto create a beautiful world where time   space and problems of our everyday life do not exist   a place of blooming blossoms   green forests and clear waters   a place really worth sacrificing your life for    because of its lack of three dimensionality   the film looses most of its possibilities   but stays afloat because of some interesting scenes   amusing performances   especially by willem dafoe   and one interesting and important thought   depicted in many different ways throughout the movie    during the film   the audience is as confused as the characters   detached from their everyday existence and no longer able to see the difference between the real world and the alternative reality that they have created       the matrix     despite of its many dark and disturbing thoughts   ends with a light at the end of the tunnel       existenz   does not    it is a one time experience   ending in blood   gore and madness   a rather frightening forecast for tomorrow</td>\n",

one   genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town and a small band of locals   assisted by a specialist in the particular animal s field   must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth    oh yeah   the military is on their way to bomb the town as well   so they are running short on time    sound familiar    such is the plot of the destination films release of bats    dina meyer stars as the   bat specialist   sheila   who is pulled from her research   along with her annoying sidekick   played with irritating deftness by leon   in order to help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently    with the help of the local sheriff   lou diamond phillips     a cdc official   carlos jacott     and a scientist   bob gunton     sheila discovers it is indeed bats   who have been genetically altered by gunton s character to be more aggressive and omnivorous   in order to be used as a military weapon        i have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film    there s not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good    in this respect   the film never disappointed me    this film reaches a level that transcends the   so bad it s good   level and borders on the downright insane    the effects are awful   the script is contrived   and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously   i think      i challenge anyone to sit through the scene   where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner   with a straight face    thankfully   the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with    dina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in   johnny mnemonic   dragonheart   and starship troopers        the latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit     and this one is no exception    while one never really gets the impression that meyer s character could be a bat expert in reality   one never really cares to doubt it either    she gives as good a performance as could be expected   plus she s nice to look at for an hour and a half    lou diamond phillips is also serviceable here   as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero    although when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what s going on in town   for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats    the only bad performance in the film is that of leon s    he is relegated to the   i m not sticking around here      character and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays    anyone who can t immediately tell that bob gunton   the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films   is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised   but i highly doubt it    even if he hadn t been the villain in just about every film he s ever been in   so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever    in fact   his death is welcome   because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale    if the plot doesn t sound ridiculous to you yet   then check out these little tidbits   a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol    an entire town disregards the sheriff and doctor s orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated   causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force   killing several townsfolk    a government official blows off shelia s instructions   to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats  cave that will kill all of them off   by pulling a night job   resulting in the death of an entire military unit    a cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it    finally   to top it all off   this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it s single screen theater   for reference   our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens   and we re lucky to even get kevin smith s dogma      the most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill conceived bat puppets    while the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing   making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what s going on     the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more low key    therefore we the audience get loving close ups of the most unrealistic   rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film    being able to see the puppeteer s arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse    after all of this   if you still decide bats might be the movie for you   don t say you haven t been warned    trust me when i say that it s a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through    i just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in    she s definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these</td>\n",

       "      <td>studio 54 attracted so many weird and bizarre people to its gates that it s a wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring   cliched individual   not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldn t be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio   which they did according to this film    are we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly   that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it       54   belongs in the elite group of films known as   the big disappointments     the films that attain so much hype and or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished    i was heavily awaiting   54     not the least because i ve become fascinated with the infamous club   which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that s been running all summer on vh1   which is   weirdly enough   much more intriguing and engrossing than this   edgy   film    perhaps more importantly     54   is part of the blossoming subgenre     the 70s nostalgia film     which has been picking up mighty steam   what with   boogie nights   and   the last days of disco   coming out within the year   and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period   the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period     but brought us interesting and real characters   like scotty   the tragically gay boom mike operator from   boogie nights     and charlotte   the ironically clueless and bitchy co protagonist from   the last days of disco     not to mention several others       54   deals not so much with the timeline of the studio   how it began   how it was run   how it ended     that s all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale   but more interested in the characters who populated it    this is a definite plus    here s a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party   and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases   economy problems   and perhaps worst of all   reagan   all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening    the story of the studio is tragedy in itself   let s look at how it all affected the people    but this film doesn t let that happen    it gives us a half assed protagonist named shane o shea   ryan phillippe   from   i know what you did last summer       who s chief character trait is the fact that he s from new jersey   which also happens to be his chief character flaw   i guess      he s dim witted   into being part of   the scene     and soon finds he s become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars       a  bit like   saturday night fever      cept no travolta and no real interest put into him    poor   poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting   but all he is a half assed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been    shane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club   like anita   salma hayek     a wannabe donna sommers   and her young hubby   greg randanzo   breckin meyer   from   clueless       who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame    although he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster   sela ward     an exec of sorts   he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black   neve campbell     and thus the boring romance subplot that s all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film    the film s sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the all too necesary personage of steve rubell   played by mike myers   you heard me      rubell   the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever   and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation   but the film   thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers   makes him out to be more than that    notice the scenes sole shocking scene   where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion   myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene   and a couple others   that some of us who ve only seen him on tv never saw   and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails    first time feature director mark christopher proves that he s a better director than a writer   though not too terribly much    his story is trite and shallow   as are his characters   and his direction is shockingly flat   especially for a film about this subject    it s as if he had a great story to tell   but instead opted for the easier route    the studio s recreation is amazingly accurate   though   and very impressive   but his direction is never captivating enough    some people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in   despite the film s tone   i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellini s   la dolce vita       and when i watched   54     i didn t particularly want to stay</td>\n",

       "      <td>as fairy tales go   cinderella has to be one of the most famous    almost everyone knows it   well at least in north america    so it is natural that someone will try to make a movie out of it    it has been done before with varying results    this version of the story is both similar to the original and different at the same time    the basic story remains unchanged but   one thing that seems to vanish with this version   and that is all the fantastical elements of the story    there is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature    after the fantastical elements are stripped away what is left is a realistic believable rendition of the cinderella story and an interesting love story at the least        unlike in the fairy tale   the prince plays a much larger part than just that of the masked ball at the end    the   prince    who happens to be the crown prince to the throne of france   meets  cinderella    known as danielle   on a few occasions   most coincidentally and he becomes smitten with her    although this seems to be a far cry from the traditional story it allows for the main plot to proceed with enough room for some imaginative story telling      the story takes place in a renaissance setting   in france   with leonardo da vinci providing some comic relief on more than one occasion    this addition of leonardo da vinci   was quite successful in that it added some color to the movie   since some of the roles are a bit stereotypical    for example the role that was scripted for the prince leaves a few things to be desired    for instance the character seems to be a bit too unstable and fickle   a crown prince should not be anything remotely like that    especially since he is portrayed to be in his mid twenties at the least and almost ready to take the throne    the characters of danielle   cinderella   played by drew barrymore   and that of the evil step mother   played by anjelica huston   are well developed and well played by the two women    although the part of danielle is a bit stretched it is not too unlikely and not totally unbelievable    the nuances of the character are brought out well by drew barrymore and from watching the movie it seems like she had fun making the movie    as a contrast the part of the evil step mother is clearly seen from the very beginning and is almost clique    but   anjelica huston seems to add a certain flair to the role that makes it suit the movie nearly perfectly    the actual story is fairly predictable since it is after all the basic story of cinderella   but there are more than enough twists in how the story is told to make it interesting and enjoyable    the acting is of high caliber and seems deserved of praise    all in all this movie takes you back into history   into a seemingly magical fairy land    but   don t get me wrong there is nothing but reality   it is just refreshing to watch a movie that is not based in a familiar setting with everyday familiar things happening    so although the story is basically familiar the world it is set in is not   and that adds a dimension to the film which in this humble reviewers opinion makes it worth seeing</td>\n",

       "0    burnt money is the perfect festival film    it will show once or twice   and then no one   thankfully   will ever have to hear from it again    this film from the seattle international film festival 2001 s emerging masters series is easily one of the year s worst    billed as a gay  bonnie and clyde    this gritty film from director marcelo pi   eyro has its only highlight in a well designed title sequence    two gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery that makes a gang leader   whose plan they screwed up   angry    this causes the gang leader to send his boys out to get the gay guys   one of whom may not actually be gay    hiding out in a prostitute s apartment   the two men must fight off police and gang members in a very long showdown for the movie s conclusion    if caught   they risk losing all the money   and their love    as an added emotional bonus   one of the gay men is dying    or something like that    everything that happens is so quick and confusing i was completely lost    clarity isn t exactly this movie s striving virtue   so it was a little hard to pick up    not much could have really happened though    the main events in this long two hour film are explicit homosexual and heterosexual sex   graphic drug use   extreme violence   and strong language    lots of explicit material is never a bad thing when there s a reason   but there s no purpose to anything in this film    most of the sex and violence scenes come off as silly   while the heavy drug use comes off as ridiculous and depressing    it appears pi   eyro   who co wrote with marcelo figueras   from a novel by ricardo piglia   purposefully adds more blood and lovemaking for his own amusement    he makes the actors as sweaty and dirty as possible   makes them snort cocaine   gives them guns and condoms   and lets them go    burnt money is pointless    the performances are bad    it tries to thrill and shock   but only causes boredom    god forbid it will ever get a

       "2    at times   you d think edtv would be an entertaining film    i mean   who can resist the story of your average joe becomming a celebrity by having his life filmed every minute of every day    but this average joe   ed perkuny     matthew mcconaughay     is a sappy   lifeless creation that wanders around   trying to solve everyone s problems and settle his own    mcconaughay is awful   especially because he is trying to pull off his usual hollywood charm with a 3 week beard and torn jeans    frankly   he had more charm in the devestating flop the newton boys    he overacts in every way   his overexaggerant body language   obsession with kissing women every second he gets the chance   and that cliched scene where he loses someone in his life   and drops to his knee and cries    the rest of the cast is very good   especially martin landau   as ed s step father     who plays a cute role as the close to death old guy that makes all the witty comments    jenna elfman is good     but a little overemotional     her main problem is that she keeps getting sucked into bad films   i   e    can t hardly wait   and krippendorf s tribe    woody harrelson   as ed s brother ray   does his usual egg headed role   with his comic wit as well   he wrote a book entitled     my brother pissed on me        elizabeth hurley is perfectly cast as the easy slut   and dennis hopper   in a quick cameo as ed s biological father   is a nice choice   ironically coming after the role he turned down as christof in the truman show      ellen degeneres stood out as the executive who   after awhile   decides the show must not go on much to the opposite of the head exec   rob reiner s opinion    i hate to compare this film to the truman show   but the fact is   i was ashamed to see this movie    it felt that i had dropped from college to kindergarten after seeing truman and ed    edtv had no real wit or genius   it was typical hollywood    extracting the tv part of the movie   you have the simple plotline   man steals brother s girlfriend   girlfriend leaves town   man gets new slut girlfriend to feel like he can move on   slut breaks up with him   real girlfriend comes back   and voila   you have a romance    i got so restless during this movie   i almost walked out    the only reason it doesn t drop below a   c   grade is because of the fine supporting performances    ad2am   i almost lost my nose       and  i like it    i like breathing through it       jack nicholson   chinatown

       "3    after a marketing windup of striking visuals and the promise of star caliber actors   mission to mars ends up throwing a whiffleball    fiercely unoriginal   director depalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him    there are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind    the stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars    the astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo 13    interior spacecraft visuals are redolent of 2001   a space odyssey    instead of using these components as a launching pad to create his own movie   de palma stops right there   refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart    mission to mars takes it s first wobbly steps at a pre launch barbeque in which the perfunctory character introductions are done    during these surface scans of the characters   we learn that jim mcconnell   sinise   has lost his wife    it s a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety    the rest of the crew exhibit a bland affability    there is no contentiousness   no friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men and women being confined to close quarters for an extended length of time    maybe depalma was going for the comraderie of the right stuff   but in that movie   the astronauts had embers of personality to warm us through the technical aspects    it s the year 2020 and this is nasa s first manned excursion to the red planet    a crew   led by luke graham   cheadle     arrives on mars and quickly discovers an anomaly   which they investigate with tragic results    graham is able to transmit a garbled distress call back to earth    in response   earth sends a rescue team comprised of mcconnell   woody blake   robbins     wife terri fisher   nielsen   and phil ohlmyer   o connell      obstacles are put in the crew s way and and they matter of  factly go about solving them    i should say   mcconnell goes about solving them    time and again   mcconnell is presented as some kind of wunderkind   which wouldn t be so bad if the rest of the crew didn t come across as so aggressivelly unremarkable       mention should be made of the misogynistic handling of fisher in a situation where the entire crew s mission and life is in mortal danger    on a team of professionals   she is portrayed as an emotion directed weak link    women serve no purpose in the movie other than to serve as a reflection of a male character s personality trait      by the time they land on mars and try to solve the mystery of what occurred   mission to mars starts laying on the cliches and stilted dialogue with a heavy brush    there is an adage in film to   show   don t tell      mission to mars does both    repeatedly    characters obsessively explain the obvious   explain their actions as they are doing them   explain to fellow astronauts facts which should be fundamental knowledge to them    the film s conclusion is momumentally derivative   anti climatic and unsatisying    as i walked out i wondered who the target audience might be for this film    the best i could come up with is pre teen age boys   but in this media saturated era   this film s components would have been old hat even for them    i have to think what attracted such talent to this film was the lure of making a good   modern day b movie    the key to such a venture is a certain depth and sincerity towards the material    i felt no such earnestness

       "4    john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles    so effortlessly that people tend to forget he s there   much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors   anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor s face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors      example   the other day my mother asked me   the expert   of course   if there were any movies out worth seeing   never mind that our tastes couldn t be more divergent    i ll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes   and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go    was a lot of fun   which it is     so i didn t see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation    i muttered   with a little trepidation   that she might enjoy high fidelity    she responded with her usual query     whose in that one      this is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see    if the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light   a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing   and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people   usually of the jewish faith   fretting about in some upper east side palace    anyway   when i answered   john cusack     she replied with a rather stunned   who       as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to    now i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies   most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin   but i suppose it s understandable that she would not recognize the name   after all   for most   names are tougher than faces    i showed her a picture of cusack s mug in the paper hoping for an   oh   him   yes he s quite good   instead i got a   no   i don t know him      at this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger   yes   filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone     till i realized something   i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack s relatively bland visage   or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise   one syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car    cu sack   cu sack   no   not quite as cool    i m sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as   the guy from   add in the cusack film of your choice        he s not a brand name   and his movies usually aren t big moneymakers   but in his own unassuming way he s kind of a genius    with his pleasant   common man looks   and charming semi articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90 s    from the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon    despite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it   the schlumpy every man     he s a constantly enjoyable screen persona   like albert brooks or woody allen    and he knows how to chose scripts   while the stephan baldwin s and val kilmer s seem to put them selves in everything   the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle   and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent     cusack generally picks rewarding projects   save for the unwatchable hot pursuit   a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller      high fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears   the grifters   the hi lo country     and it s a hit    it was also co written by cusack   and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy   grosse point blank    it s not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film   but as it progresses in its meandering fashion   the movie cast something of a spell over me    high fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non committal rob   a vinyl record store owner   who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his   top 5 break ups list      this is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller s day off    at first the talking directly into the camera schtick had me vaguely annoyed   mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit   but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack s witty delivery    he s the kind of guy we don t mind talking directly to us    gradually the film settles into a shampoo like tragi comic character study   of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is   yes it s all very existential      though that plot line is mostly enjoyable   the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters   all of whom   now this is really something   are terrific enough to warrant their own films    the best of which is jack black   of the very funny show tenacious d   a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis  hair       unfortunately that annoying smirk remains     an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy    he s the kind of guy i m sure we ve all met before   a blowhard who thinks he s always right and will do anything in his power   be it yell   argue   insult   to hoist his opinion onto others    but i like this guy   because of how black plays him    the actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes   but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak   which might be a bit of a redundant description   seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic      he s the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films       look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister      but fears and black never let that happen    the character   for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality    he s over the top   but in a way we can all probably relate to    catherine zeta jones   in her brief role   gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own   charm      tim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age type   a character played entirely for cartoon yuks   but still manages to work its desired comic effect    the one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy   the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle   mifune     who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent   replacing it with a stilted american phonation    i give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role   but instead of being likeable   she comes across as rather robotic   and as such it s hard to see why cusack s character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful   intelligent writer   natasha gregson wagner   potentially waiting in the wings    this reminded me of say anything   where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye   and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood   whose unbelievably more wooden then father   clint for those   special people   whose wheels turn a little slower      in fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his   though i d bet that if laura and natasha switched roles   the result would be more effective    high fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances    fears  direction is somewhat stilted   and the script is sometimes a little too   and this is a word i m beginning to hate to use but alas i must   quirky for its own good   i think i ll blame that on scott rosenberg   who judging from what he did with beautiful girls   con air   and things to do in denver while your dead   has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie      but cusack really does deserve an award   for being so damn       cusackian    i m afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent    his character   rob   whose sort of like an older   more bitter lloyd from say anything   is funny and tragic without being pathetic   and that cusack can do all this   and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences   is something of an achievement

       "5    every once in a while a movie comes along that completely redefines the genre   with dramas   it was citizen kane   with arthouse it was pulp fiction   and with comedy it was   well   that jim carrey guy   okay   so he s not a movie   but he did have a huge influence on the genre    not to mention an expensive one      sometimes a movie even combines them all into a big   sprawling motion picture event   as did forrest gump four years ago    with action films   it was aliens   whic was released to much hype seven years after it s equally innovative parent   alien   1979      directed and written by james cameron   t2   judgement day   the abyss   true lies     the authority on action films   it was a masterful encore to his sci fi thriller the terminator   1984      while the original alien film was a dark   enclosed horror film that featured one alien slowly massacering a horrified crew   james cameron took the big budget action film with aliens   which featured multiple aliens doing basically the same thing   although on a much larger scale    and boy   did he take that route    i d say at about 165 mph or so        the film opens 57 years after the original   with lt   ripley   weaver   being found in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel    if you ll recall   at the end of alien ripley   the only surviving member   cryogenically   hibernated   herself after expelling the rogue alien from her ship    unfortunately   she thought she d only be out for a couple of weeks        once she s returned to earth   ripley is quickly interrogated by   the company     who quickly dismiss her and her stories as lunacy    in truth   they believe her   as they soon approach ripley with an offer to travel with some marines to a new colony planet as an   alien advisor      it seems that the colony planet was a once breeding ground for the nasty aliens   and now all communication with the planet has been lost        it doesn t exactly take a genius to guess what happens next   ripley agrees   and before you can say   big mistake     she and the half dozen marines   plus the slimy corporate guy   reiser     who has more than it looks like up under his sleeve   are off to the colony    when they arrive   they find the planet in ruins    only one survivor is found   a little girl   newt   who confirms that   yes   the aliens were here and that she only managed to survive by hidding in the ventilation system    and soon enough   the marines come under attack from the aliens        what happens for the next hour and a half or so is what completely sets this movie apart from any other standard alien sci fi movie   the action scenes    cameron directs them so skillfully   and so suspensefully   that you re literally ringing your hands by the time the finale rolls around    which features   in my opinion   the best fight scene ever recorded on film   as ripley straps herself into a huge robot and battles the nasty queen alien to the death    many people will tell you that this film   while being a great action film   has no real drama and is all cliches    well   they would be wrong   my friends    if this film had no   drama     then why was sigourney weaver nominated for best actress at the 1987 academy awards    that s right   best actress    you know that any action film that has an oscar nomination attached to it for something other than technical stuff like editing and f x has got to be good    in short   aliens combines all the right elements   great action and f x   drama   a good plot   good dialogue   and great villains   into what could arguably be called the best action film of all time    then again   maybe not    movies rise and fall from glory and   sad to say   aliens was wrestled from it s

       "6    for better or worse   the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated   oversexed   underwritten thrillers    apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesn t change a thing   since body of evidence wasn t written by him   but has a puzzling eszterhas ish presence all over it    in other words   it s a   really dirty and b   really   really stupid    madonna   first warning sign   stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job   she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around semi naked   presumably for the edification of the shrimp    she s been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover    already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect    the first being that any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless she s under thirty   or at least looks it     and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men    what s worse is that the movie confirms all the above   and wallows in them as well    madonna s character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition       and yes   there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy    this movie leave no scummy stone unturned      anyway   willem dafoe   very good but completely wasted   also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonna s sexuality    how do we know this    because his character is set up with the token wife and kids    how obvious is it that he s gonna cheat on her and have to fess everything up    and get kicked out of the house    and get welcomed back anyway    don t skip to the end yet   we re just getting warmed up    dafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie    most of it is about as erotic as open heart surgery   since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax   always the kink of choice among screenwriters who don t know the first thing about   really   kinky sex   and smashed light bulbs    don t ask    another thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story   it s insanely dull    what s worse is that body of evidence is dull   everywhere     not just in the sex scenes    the stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninth hand from other bad courtroom drama scenes    the thriller business itself is ridiculous    it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs   and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor    and the ending    another homage to eszterhas   maybe       is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact   frame   where one of the five or six various endings to this mess was spliced in    the director is uli edel   all the more disappointing since he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit to brooklyn and christiane f   everyone has to eat   i guess   but this isn t a meal ticket   it s leftovers

       "7       first rule of fight club is   don t talk about fight club      this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film   because quite frankly   it s not even worth mentioning    director david fincher   seven   has completely gone over the edge    with crude humor   an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture   i m surprised i didn t walk out    this just goes to show that hype kills    it s very rare that a film so hyped up as   fight club   turns out to be noteworthy   and this is no exception    the story goes like this    edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions   until he meets marla   helena bonham carter      norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle   when he spots her at a session that he also attended    apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like   literally living in pain    why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me   but things do get worse    norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling   and it s on a plane that he meets tyler durden   brad pitt      the two men develop a bond   and go out to a bar   and by golly after they get drunk   the two pitiful characters fight    how do they come up with this stuff    anyway   their fighting catches other pathetic loser s attention   and a club is formed    out of all this mess   there manages to lie a message    fincher shows us that society is like robots    we work in our jobs doing things step by step   and want out    our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are   and we blame it on others    call me crazy   but this is common knowledge    i think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is   which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably    even with two good actors   and a solid actress   they only manage to weaken the story    i couldn t help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp    it just shows how desperate the script is for attention    i guess brad pitt was right for this role   because i felt like beating him up myself    his bothersome and depressing character   made me disgusted at his 20 million fee    it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more    helena bonham carter however really had no purpose    she just popped up on screen   mumbled some lines   smoked and left    this continues for what seems like 6 hours    the film drags on and my headache gets bigger   while   fight club   nears what i think might be the end    unfortunately by then   the film hits rock bottom    though the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes   it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace    on a side note   the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film   that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer    fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson    concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment   won t do any good if everything else is in need of support    also   i m afraid that immature men might respond to the film s violence    the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult    when the film ends   i m just glad to get home and take some advil    you ll either enjoy what the film has to offer   or agree with ed norton when he says   this is so f       ing stupid

       "8    it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive   so delicate   so insightful and yes   even so enjoyable    somehow   the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through    set in the 1940 s   the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells   tobey maguire   ride with the devil      an orphan   twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents   he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr   wilbur larch   michael caine   little voice     father figure to the orphans of st   cloud   obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help    figuring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage   he might as well be of use   dr   larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics    soon homer is delivering babies like a professional    he refuses to perform abortions   instead wondering why the couples just didn t behave more responsibly    larch   too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals   marvels that homer   continues to have such high expectations of people      such is the result of an insulated upbringing    though skilled in certain medical procedures   homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else    he finally figures that in order to find his place in the world   he must go out into it    befriending a young couple who had come to see dr   larch   he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived    thus   homer begins his worldly instruction   with new friend candy kendall   charlize theron   the astronaut s wife   a willing tutor    tobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to life s questions        many of which he was unaware needed to be asked    he demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing    michael caine is   in a word   brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans   many of whom he helped to bring into the world    calling them   princes of maine   kings of new england   in his ritualistic goodnight   mr   caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine    delroy lindo   a life less ordinary   has many powerful moments as mr   rose   the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins    director lasse hallstrom   what s eating gilbert grape     and screenwriter novelist john irving   the world according to garp     who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter    regardless of one s personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion   it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers    the title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers    figuring the rules didn t apply to them since they didn t have a hand in writing them   they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along    dr   larch   in his own way   acts similarly    there is a danger in that line of reasoning    god has also given us a set of rules    unlike the list posted in the cider house   god s rules   if followed   promise us benefits beyond our imagination    and yet   many continue to ignore his   rules   preferring to make up their own as they go through life       trust in the lord with all thine heart   and lean not unto thine own understanding      proverbs 3   5  kjv   just as a builder follows a designer s blueprint or a conductor follows a composer s score   why shouldn t we follow the rules of life given to us by life s architect for our own blessing

       "9    late in down to you   the lead female character   julia stiles   states her greatest fear is having an   artificial conversation   with her boyfriend   freddie prinze jr        the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out   fallen asleep   or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy    the film is a multi million dollar testament to everything artificial    filled with characters   motivation   plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster    prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles  freshman co ed    at first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out doing the previous in how   cute   it can be    the happy couple   psychoanalyze   each other   they pick out a song because   as prinze s dj mother   lucie arnez   explains   every couple needs a song   he smells her shampoo   she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love    then   in standard romantic comedy style   things fall apart    why    well   because they have to    otherwise the couple can t make up and live   presumably   happily ever after    down to you exists outside the realm of normal logic    scenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism   but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead    a picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre   not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together   or even knowing each other   but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat    the supporting characters are remarkably flat   and insultingly ridiculous as well    stiles  best friend   rosario dawson   is a pot head   prinze s roommate   shawn hatosy   is a girl crazy fool who can t meet women   and then there are the porn stars   zak orth and selma blair      he is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television   does the college lecture circuit   and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film    you know   the average porn star    the costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he s on screen   the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes    she is a porn star mostly so we know she s slutty   so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted    attempts at drama   which means julia is going to cry   include a pregnancy scare and the big break up    these characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes    what happened here    the cast is full of likable   promising   young actors   stiles especially seems to be going places      writer director kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off    in fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last year s extremely unpleasant the story of us   for teen audiences    the direction is film school grad obvious    it s stylish in a hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen   a pointless parody of   cops     characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters   and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion    plus   the whole story is told flashback style   narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera    this is the second film in a row   following wing commander   starring freddie prinze jr   which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she s all that    if he doesn t start making better choices fast his future films won t be so lucky

       "10   when i was asked to see this movie with a friend   my initial reaction was   not hugh grant      i was perhaps wrong to be so harsh   but after his insidious flirtation with a street hooker   i just could not picture him in any romantic lead    what makes this movie a wonderful experience is not the fact it stars hugh   but because it stars julia and carries with it a brilliantly written script    this writer richard curtis   whose exceptional first work   four weddings and funeral  shows us that he is a master in the domain of the romantic comedy   with splashes of drama thrown in between    hugh and his hair   is almost identical to the character that made him famous in   four weddings     he plays an ordinary guy who is down and out on his luck    unfortunately   he is type cast in this role   but fortunately it works well for him in this movie    if only he would dither a little less    julia knows this role well    the glamorous movie star who is searching for true love    there are moments in this movie   that you almost weep for her pain felt loneliness    how sad it must be to be so wealthy and beautiful   but to have no one to share it with    the writer deals with difficult issues of love and social class on various levels    how differences in social standing can make it almost impossible for love to grow in such a harsh environment    how the media can be as cruel as it can be attentive   and how fulfilment in life and love can be found in forgiveness and sacrifice

       "11   i am starting to write this review before going to see strawberry and chocolate   cuba s oscar nominee for best foreign film   directed by tomas gutierrez alea   who also directed the sometimes and in some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo     memories of underdevelopment      i saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema class back in the late  70s   it merged the politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition    i knew then that memorias was probably a state sanctioned political missive   and now expect strawberry will follow suit    fellow internetters   primarily in the newsgroup dedicated to cuba   soc   culture   cuba     have mentioned that strawberry is a harsh criticism of the revolution and its current state of affairs    i have jumped to the conclusion that strawberry is nothing more than a veiled attempt at espousing the party line  it probably looks like political criticism   but it ain t so    having some first hand and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castro s repressiveness   i can t conceive of his tolerating honest and adversarial criticism of the revolution   and i can t imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement    as kids say these days   duh     the revolution s current state needs no criticism   its physical and spiritual crumbling is self evident    the proper questions to put relate to castro s legitimacy    i bet the film takes castro s power for granted   and that this or any other movie   produced under cuba s state control   cannot question his right to run cuba s political show   ongoing now for more than 36 years      that s why i just can t believe strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime    let s see what happens after the room goes dark and the screen lights up    i saw the film  twice    i was right   castro remained intact    strawberry negotiates the relationship between a young   dialectic materialist     as he describes himself   and a homosexual photographer   diego   in 1979 cuba    the young man   david   is the son of peasants   a symbol of the revolution s reason for being    grateful to the revolution for the opportunity to receive a university education   he studies political science instead of literature   his avocation   because he perceives it is his duty    therein lies a likely unintended irony   since cuba has no need for political theoreticians    cuba s government is castro    diego s lifestyle is the antithesis of revolutionary life    he enjoys the finer things  tea   opera   art    he does not do   voluntary work   for the revolution    his small apartment is a sensual oasis    the moniker   bourgeois   figuratively hangs over his head during the early parts of the movie    however   he is a   revolucionario   in his own way    the supporting roles are filled by   an aging busybody with a heart of gold and a troubled psyche   david s roommate   who rally takes the communist party line to its expected extreme   david s ex girlfriend   who dumped him for another guy   yet wants to bed him before she leaves for italy with her husband   german   a gay sculptor whose work diego is attempting to exhibit   and who strikes a faustian pact with the government    gutierrez alea and co director juan carlos tabio do a fine job at almost showing that homosexuals can be revolutionaries too    heck   towards the end of the film you begin to think the guy deserves a medal for his patriotic fervor    he really loves the revolution   as supposedly does everybody else in cuba   and wants to make it better by exposing and correcting some of its flaws    real criticism is missing though    this movie is political window dressing    luis aguilar leon s op    ed    piece on fresa in the miami herald   10 march 1995   at 21a   did not color my judgment   it presaged my intuition    aguilar leon expressed my sentiment about this film s political angle best   like many artistic manifestations in cuba   strawberry and chocolate sprang from a totally manipulated environment    as art critic ivan de la nuez well states in the latest issue of the magazine postmodern notes   the silenced artists are those who refuse to accept   the charade in which artists can provoke up to a point   while the institutions legitimize themselves by forbidding them to go beyond that point      although terrible propaganda   this is otherwise a fine film

       "12   near the end of 1996   analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king    the following year   1997   saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom   twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia    at best   that s all it was    a sleeper hit   designed to surprise but not shake the industry    in 1998   however   things have been decidedly different    there have been a number of pushes on disney s death grip on the market   and fifty one weeks into  98   a new champion has emerged    dreamworks  the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed    the other two contenders   warner brothers  quest for camelot and disney s own annual entry   mulan   lacked inspiration and drive respectively    although camelot was borderline abysmal   and can t really be considered a shot at the title   mulan had the makings of winner    unfortunately   it was saturated with traditional   disney cute animation   and lost points against the rapidly changing face of the competition    in making the prince of egypt   dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product    the animation is flawless   and   aside from a bug s life   is the best looking movie to date    the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects   and the 2d 3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with    the key to success   however   was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot    namely   some of the most important action sequences   like the parting of the red sea   were done almost entirely in 3d    dreamworks is the first studio to prove that they ve got the stuff of success   and that they re capable of challenging disney    the story is also well written   and the characters voiced with talent    for the most part   the plot follows its source material    the book of exodus    although only in the most general sense    the writers took a few creative liberties   and most do not damage the story in any way    in fact   the shakespearean relationship between moses   val kilmer   and the pharaoh rameses   ralph fiennes   makes the story more interesting if anything    moses   a hebrew   is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile   he floats into the pharaoh seti   patrick stewart    s palace and is taken in by the royal family    moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert   where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves    by this time   rameses is now pharaoh   and the two brothers   now on opposite sides of the line   face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention    the cast of voices is most impressive   and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock   jeff goldblum   danny glover   and steve martin    the script does not have a lot of one liners in it   and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams   but overall the story is exciting and interesting    it s decidedly for an older crowd   and the tykes who haven t had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost    but for those who make the bid   the prince of egypt can be a great watch

       "13   note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    james toback s return to directing after a eight year layoff   two girls and a guy   is a film which is comprised   more or less   of just that   one guy   blake   robert downey jr       two girls   carla   heather graham   and lou   natasha gregson wagner     one primary setting   blake s absurdly spacious bachelor apartment     and a great deal of dialogue    embracing a near real time approach   this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr   toback for his bantering characters    fortunately   the film s cast is up to the challenge   and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters   while admittedly variable   are occasionally wickedly amusing    the film s setup is fairly generic in nature   and opens rather unpromisingly    we meet self possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou   both waiting outside a soho loft    as they engage in idle chatter   it is revealed that they re both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport   and it doesn t take long for them to come to the realisation that they re being two timed by the same guy    more indignant with him than catty with each other   the duo break into blake s loft and await his arrival for a confrontation    it s when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride    played with magnificent bombast by mr   downey jr     blake is a cad   all right   but a captivatingly dynamic   blusterous   and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights    it s fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat   and perhaps the film s best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return   allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others   but by his own innate behaviour    whether he s flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi   or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds   carla   lou   and his unseen sickly mother     it s never less than wildly entertaining and insightful    though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one man show    a typical afternoon in the life of blake   if you will    carla   and then lou   reveal themselves   and the sparks begin to fly       one of the great touches in the film is how blake   when startled by carla s unannounced appearance   begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat s out of the bag      double teamed by the understandably aggrieved women   who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful    they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy     an increasingly flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self righteous declarations against their verbal jabs    surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters   two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off limits for this film    however   it d be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou s outrage to full feature length   and it s as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel    the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever   the film s tempo loses its liveliness   the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion   and several sequences fall flat    subtle and not quite subtle allusions are made   a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall     and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale    one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla    two girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter   long running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene    contractually obligated to deliver an r rated film   mr   toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc 17 rating in favour of an r    and while admittedly titillating   the net effect of the vignette on the film s thematic narrative is rather dubious    if anything   two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr   downey jr     whose versatility is put to the test in this film    he plays the gamut from indignant to humbled   from self assured to disconcerted   yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered    it s a wonderful performance in a role custom tailored for him   mr   toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr   downey jr   was arrested on drug charges   and it s hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character    in a monologue to his mirrored reflection   blake s self chiding to   get  his  shit together   is disquieting in its resonance    while mr   downey jr    s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film   both actresses are solid in more broadly observed roles    ms   graham is quickly becoming one of america s more daring actresses   involving herself in three successive risky projects    two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank   while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman    she s quite appealing here   playing a character at once both dainty and sultry    meanwhile   ms   gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying   or   like me   endearing    she tones it down substantially as the film progresses   but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox    the film was reportedly shot in eleven days   filmed mostly in sequence   and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout    two girls and a guy has an agile   spontaneous sort of feel   and one senses that mr   toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors    while the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact   it doesn t feel constricted   the expansive apartment setting is well used to vary the background   and mr   toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner    two girls and a guy falls short of its potential   but thanks to some stellar work by mr   downey jr     it s still often an enjoyable   bitingly funny romp   particularly as we watch the surprisingly resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends       i m an actor     he tells them at one point   using the ol  tried and tested occupational hazard defense       actors lie      but not   they all seem to agree   denzel washington

       "14   capsule   the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies   dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension    alien 3   the   3   should be in superscript   is a sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen    it continues the story of ripley   the space trucker turned impromptu survivalist   but seems remarkably uninterested in her    in fact   the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all   it s so elegaic and limp    a little of this would have been nice for atmosphere   but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning    at the end of the last film   aliens     ripley and two survivors were on their way home    unfortunately   an alien pod had been deposited in their ship   and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod    the pod crashes on firorina 161   a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent    ripley lives through the crash   the others do not    the prison is a grim place   even as prisons go    it s been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks   which provides no end of techno gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against    lice are endemic   and so ripley s head is shaved   another surreal touch      at first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until a company rescue ship can arrive   but it doesn t stay that way    one of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches   and soon a newly gestated alien is running amuck    worse   it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated    what s weird is how little tension this generates   except near the end   when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable   loud music   shaky camerawork   etc   sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role   and she does well with it   but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack    the supporting actors are also not given a lot to do   the doctor   charles dance   and another   rather religious inmate   charles s   dutton   very good     hiave presence   but they re not asked to do anything with it    in light of the impending sequel   which apparently plays fast and loose with the ending of this movie   i will not talk about the ending    except to say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movie    it s strange that some of the desperate and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story couldn t have driven the rest of it

       "15   the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes   and the greedy trade federation has used it s armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo    we soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboo s ruler   the young queen amidala   natalie portman   to sign a treaty giving the federation control    however   the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui gon jinn   liam neeson   and obi wan kenobi   ewan mcgregor   as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade    no sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi   and the first battle begins    it seems that for me and thousands of people like me   the love for george lucas s trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time    we re the fans   not the freaks    we won t go dressing up like darth vader   although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool     and we won t incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations   not all the time   anyway     but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest   we re throwing down    all right   stop looking at me like that    we have been faithfully and patiently waiting    waiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll    you see   the trilogy is not just a set of movies   but a religion of sorts to we   the faithful disciples   and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah    unfortunately   it is not our savior    for weeks beforehand   i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good   stupendously good   miraculously good    anything less and it ll be the biggest disappointment of the century    i didn t want the doomsaying prophecy to come true   really i didn t   but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking    character development is virtually nonexistent    with the possible exception of qui gon   most of the film s characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions    none seem very affected by their experiences   and few even show any passion at all    contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks   a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo   in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala    jar jar s life is saved by qui gon early in the film   and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh   or supposedly so      his speech mannerisms are so   cute ified   that i couldn t understand a third of what he was saying   and the slapstick he performed was just distracting    his head gets caught in an electronic field   his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast   he describes being in trouble as   deep doo doo     and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport    therein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors    in star wars   we had obi wan telling us mos eisley was a   wretched hive of scum and villainy      in the phantom menace   we get doo doo    the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story   a long time ago in a galaxy far   far away            this film   on the other hand   constantly reminds me that it s only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience    perhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition   it s kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses     and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500 like play by play    i liked the pod race   it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension   but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters    the race would have been even more exciting without the distraction    this aspect   coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me    i suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer   but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all    didn t millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again    didn t the action figures still sell like hotcakes    of course they did   and it s only poor judgment that allows the most eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults    one aspect that will appeal broadly   however   is the use of special effects    the people at lucas s industrial light and magic   the world s premiere effects house   outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer generated images and real life footage    some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed   especially the shots of a land battle between the federation s robot army and jar jar s countrymen    the space battles are also impressive   although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer    this   however   is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today    john williams is back   of course   providing a score for the film as only he can    his music is pervasive throughout   as rousing and as dramatic as ever   always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately    since this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine episode story   star wars   the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four   five and six   respectively     the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already   in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar    as a result   attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin    it would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obi wan   for example   but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover   it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films    one of the new characters is darth maul   hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film s release    in spite of the hype   darth maul is a character which almost didn t have to be in the film   his role is so insignificant    he has maybe three spoken lines   believe it or not   a second actor voices the character   and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean    with that working against him   he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment    lucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe   something which has been prominent throughout    however   he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible   offering an easy out for story writing and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a real life connection    oddly   while trying to capitalize on spirituality   lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little force loving parasites in your body s cells    this only serves to de mystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection    don t let me mislead you too far    the phantom menace   by most standards   is a good film    it contains a lot of visual treats   sets the stage for an epic story   gives us a bit of excitement here and there   and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends    it s just that when held up to it s predecessors   and to not do so would be unrealistic     this film simply pales

       "16   ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon   the book of the dead    bruce campbell stars as ash   who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods   and his friends who have become demons   including his own girlfriend      the results shown on screen are amazing considering the film s tiny budget   constant location changes   and a filming schedule that was sporadic over two years    followed by two sequels   evil dead ii   1987   and army of darkness   1993      the dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in it s original aspect ratio of 1   33   1    the disc contains two versions of the film s audio   a stereo 2   0 track and a newly remastered dolby digital 5   1    included are two separate running commentary tracks   the first features writer director sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the film s star   bruce campbell    campbell s commentary is informative and extremely witty   as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film    such informative tidbits include   the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead   and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was it s title   and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead   everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard    also   there s a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to a tape recorder which they ve found that s explaining about the demonic forces in the woods    for that scene   it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana   so being the wacky kids that they were at the time   they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene    almost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actor s had never smoked before   and as a result they became   confused   and were unable to perform the scene    i wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimi rob tapert audio track    the two people you d think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all    don t get me wrong here   when they do speak it s entertaining to hear   but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time    sometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask   have anything to say sam      to me   that s not a good sign    also   it seems like sam raimi doesn t remember much about the film and it s production        well   compared to rob and bruce anyway    also included on the disc is a photo gallery   which includes pictures from the film s   gala   premiere   and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film    this raw footage really shows you how much a film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques    overall   the evil dead is a good low budget horror film   superior to many films in it s genre    and the collector s edition dvd release is well worth your time if you re either a fan of the film or just a fan of the filmmaking process    all special edition dvds should be this thorough and entertaining

       "17   magnolia left me relling from the theatre   staggering from the relentless assault of an adventurous director reveling in his craft    at nearly three and a half hours   magnolia will strike some as a brute of a film    it not only demands your attention   but challenges you to grasp the significance of seemingly unrelated storylines and hidden intentions    it is delirious   depressing   heady   pretentious   surreal filmmaking    it s also a movie that will polarize its viewers    director paul thomas anderson takes a talented cast   wraps them in a net of interrelated stories and sets them spinning in a symphony of despair whose song doesn t let up until an oddly exhilerating   biblically influenced pseudo climax    the character s make up a modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in which they live their lives    there is frank mackey   tom cruise     a slithery snake charmer of men whose   search and destroy   seminars teach how to mentally rape a woman to get into her pants    there is earl partridge   jason robards     a dying media tycoon yearning to make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son    there is game show host jimmy gator   phillip baker hall     a self absorbed tv icon who is hiding more than a few secrets from his public    and there is police officer jim kurring   john c   reilly     who cloaks himself in the codification of organized religion and the legal system   perhaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision making process    given equal weight are stories involving a coke addled emotional cripple   melora walters     a former tv quiz show champion   william h   macy      a materialistic   adulterous wife   julianne moore     a child   jeremy blackman   victimized by a mentally abusive parent   and a caring   empathetic nurse   philip seymour hoffman      hovering over all these characters is a cloud of death   lies and despair    it is not a pleasant movie    there is not one bad note in the acting    it is affecting and layered and wonderful    there is a moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals work he has done in whole films    then he tops himself with a mesmerizing deathbed scene    walters plays her character with red eyed rawness and a fierce self destructiveness that is anxiety inducing    robards convincingly portrays a fading whisper of a man   who still hears a lion s roar when he speaks    director anderson has apparently given the actors lattitude to emote    the problem is that he stays on them too long    julianne moore s character   linda   quickly escalates to a frenzied pitch of guilt   tears   screaming and remorse and never backs off from it    after a few hours   it turns from interesting to chinese water torture    quite a few scenes   such as the game show   go on just a bit too long and will be off putting for those used to a pat 90 minute film where the main theme is reiterated several times just in case you missed it the first go around    and just what is the theme    alienation    hopelessness    anderson challenges you to draw your own conclusions and he doesn t make it easy    the film starts by showing three   strange and seemingly unrelated events    it s a harbinger of the synchronicity to come    at times   different stories reach reach key moments at the same time    other times   stories seem to veer off into uncharted territory   regardless of what else is happening    anderson is audacious enough to even have a group sing in the middle of the film    what s surprising is that it mostly works    if you have doubts about anderson s intentions   i ll ask you to pay attention to the final frame    despite all the sturm und drang   magnolia ultimately speaks to man s capacity for hope and attempts at redemption    despite magnolia s needlessly long running time and its propensity for uneven editing as anderson plays the auteur   showing off fro the masses   i have to admire his

       "18   often similar to a little boy lost in a park that he had no right venturing into   the call of the oboe   o toque do oboe   is a disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray    many elements of the film are solid   and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know   but they simply don t convert into a solid work    although a setting is never established   it becomes apparent    the film takes place somewhere in a latin american village in present day    the community is a dull one   where every day is a downhill slide from the last    over time   the people have taken to themselves    the town cinema is closed   no tourist has passed through in years   and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger    so what happens when a   tourist     paolo betti   does arrive one day    he sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock    it is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby    when he sits down in the park one day to give a solo performance   the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years    it is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers   and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to a silent film   thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages    the woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner   leticia vota   who also happens to be engaged to the town s police inspector   a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiance s involvement with this musician    the rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly astray    it features a character who literally rises from his grave   a woman who has a phone conversation with god   and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character   to an almost humorous drunk    technically   this film is a nightmare    the music score is poorly edited into the film   so it is often choppy   rough   and abrupt    the lighting is poor at best   which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes   and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words   and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases    this translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue   but the subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words    in addition   the pace of the film seems uneven    it opens with a series of long panoramic shots that alone can test one s patience    the film then moves into a faster pace   that again slows towards the end   as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark    there was   however   potential for this film    it is a piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music   and the re unification of people    these are all topics that could easily fill a movie    perhaps   if there were no freak show   and the technical aspects were to improve   there might just be a thing of beauty at the end    most importantly   though   the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours aren t such a bore    until then   there seems to be little more hope for this piece   than that boy has by simply crying out   mommy

       "19   ah   and 1999 was going along so well   too       she s all that   has the dubious distinction of being the worst movie i ve seen so far this year    and quite frankly   i doubt i ll see anything equally bad       at least   i   hope   i don t see anything equally bad         she s all that   tells the story of the most popular guy in school   played by freddie prinze jr     who accepts a bet to transform the geekiest girl in school   rachel leigh cook   into the most popular    that   right there   is problem  1    how many times have we seen this storyline    as cook comments near the end of the film     it s kind of like   pretty woman     except without the prostitution      of course   had the filmmakers attempted to try something new with this material   the well worn storyline would have been a device to propell the movie forward    as it is   though     she s all that   relies   completely   on the lame and overused formula to push it ahead    there s not one original or interesting character in the film   either   and if that wasn t bad enough   there s not one good performance featured    the star of the movie   rachel leigh cook   is simply horrible    i usually don t like to get so personal   but in this case   i think it needs to be said    cook wears the same expression throughout the flick and looks to be having as miserable a time as i was    i was never convinced that she was a   nerd     and her transformation was unconvincing and unnecessary    the movie seems to be saying it s better to be popular than to be who you are    as for freddie prinze jr     an actor i ordinarily enjoy   he too is quite bad here    he coasts through the film on so called charm   and never establishes a real character    kieren culkin is here   too   as the brother of cook    and for some indiscernable reason   he s got hearing aids    no explanation is given and they re never brought up    were we supposed to feel   sorry   for him just because he wore hearing aids    i don t think so    that single element of the film was one of the most offensive things i ve seen in a movie in a long time       she s all that   sucks    that s what it boils down to    it s not entertaining   and it s not even a good time passer    the hour and a half running time goes by slower than a 5 minute hair removal system informercial    and what s worse   it sends out a bad message to teens    it appears to be telling them     hey   it doesn t matter if you re happy the way you are    that s unimportant    if you want to   truly   be happy   dress in the latest fashions and act like a bubble headed moron      ugh

       "20   synopsis   shrek   myers   is an ogre living in contented solitude deep in the heart of a forest   until his home is invaded by fairy tale creatures fleeing the rule of the evil lord farquaad   john lithgow      farquaad agrees to relocate the pests   on the condition that shrek rescues princess fiona   diaz      whom farquaad desires to wed    from a far off castle    grudgingly   shrek sets out   joined in his quest by an unwanted companion   donkey   murphy      review   one memorable aspect of disney s   aladdin   was that it finally gave robin williams a character    the genie    to best take advantage of his comic talents       shrek   does the same for eddie murphy   ironically   though   murphy s ideal vessel turns out to be an ass    all the same     shrek   does represent murphy s best comic outing in years   and as donkey he steals all the best lines    for instance   after getting belted with pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature   donkey soars into the air and scoffs     now i m a flying talking donkey      and despite its many contributors   the script for   shrek   is full of such comic gems    myers is delightful in more of a straight man role   and lithgow also gets some great moments   watch for a hilarious repartee with the gingerbread man         shrek   takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy tales and nursery rhymes of all sorts   and reserves a few delightful knocks at disney in the bargain    things do go somewhat astray during the film s middle segment   which concentrates too much on the main characters at the expense of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which is the movie s greatest strength    but even then   one can always sit back and enjoy the beautiful computer animation   whose remarkable use here represents yet another dazzling leap forward for the technology

       "21   writers   dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh   based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer    starring   jamie lee curtis   william baldwin   donald sutherland   joanna pacula   sherman augustus   marshall bell   cliff curtis   julio oscar mechoso  i suppose i m not extremely surprised that   virus   comes to us from a deciple of james cameron   john bruno     and if i strain real hard   i could even say that it s an obvious given   particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr   cameron s early works    in fact     virus   is yet another in the long line of action horror paranoia thrillers from the   aliens   vein   a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally threatening entity is out to get them   a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies   and maybe even to the first pictures   albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future    no such thing will happen to bruno   whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi landmark feature   while bruno may have studied under cameron s wing for years and years   i m beginning to wonder at what capacity   and what exactly did he learn from him    in fact     virus   should at least be mediocre   the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron   a director who   if anything   just knows how to make a movie   and then make a film like   virus   is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z grade schlockfest of a film   albeit a z grade schlockfest with a respectable budget    the film seems to not only borrow it s plot from last year s similarly fated   deep rising     but also from a clunkish b movie from the  80s called   leviathan     an underwater thriller starring peter weller   richard crenna   hector elizando   and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part   alien     part john carpenter s twisted remake of   the thing         virus     again   has a similar   uh   selling point   a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water    they get on    they break up into pairs and investigate    and they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy   has taken over all the machines on board   have meshed the machines with parts from corpses   and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary   ha ha      not that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving   not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond ian opening   the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir     destroying any of the suspense in what could happen   but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters    of its motley crew   it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper   a masculine potential romantic interest   a drunken captain   a black technician   a tatooed aborigine   a manic russian survivor   and a couple other candidates for alien food   none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin   plain piece of writing paper    and it s not the traditional argument for films like these   where you may in fact want them all to be eaten   even   aliens   played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers   but this was more of a plus side for the film as a whole than the opposite     instead   as another cliche goes   you just don t give a damn    i almost don t even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub par to horrific   the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is   and she is   just not really here   and the latter being   and it pains me to say this as he s a particular favorite of mine   donald sutherland   who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance of which he should be ashamed    like anthony hopkins for   legends of the fall     the line   scrooooooo  em   has been thus embroidered upon my membrance      or peter o toole in   caligula      great actor   horrific performance    it happens every now and then   and it only helps sutherland s career that no one   except for an elite few   even bothered to see this film    though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years   waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can   read   early january   when everyone s still trying to catch up on the potential oscar nominees     it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film   it s laden with complex machinery   boasts respectable production design   and it may even feature believable special effects       if   of course   i   or anyone else   could see them       virus   mostly takes place on a large   abandoned cruiser   and mostly at night until the dawn   and mostly without the use of lights   not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey   but more so because   as the hollywood cliche seems to go     if it s dark enough   then the special effects will be more believable      and if you don t believe me   go back and rent   godzilla     and tell me if there s even one shot where we see godzilla either a   in his entirety in one wide shot   or b   n the light so that we can at least see him   well   you don t really have to sit through it again   just take my word for it      but all of this doesn t matter since   virus   is basically just one loud   cluttered mess of a movie    the action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i ve ever seen   my   um   favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship   during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves   rain   and any other ocean extremeties the film can cook up   then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned   well   i must say   thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn t figure it out when i saw it      imagine the first attack of the aliens in   aliens     shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity   and that s basically the whole of   virus     one horribly directed action scene after the other   capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members    and my god   it s a long damn sit    with no interesting characters   no dramatic urgency   no tension   not one good moment of action   and no mesmerizing visuals   it s a wonder that it even got made    we already know that big movie studios  mentality is shallow at best   and movies like   out of sight   and   saving private ryan   give you more faith in them   but movies like   virus   manage to drain a little more out of the pool    i almost wish that instead of making this movie   john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light    they read the script   they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack   and he is     and they still went ahead with the project   only to have bruno and company shit back in their face    even though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie   i d say even more contempt should be aimed at mr   bruno for making a movie that could be this bad    in fact   shouts of   egad   man   what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway      are not only justifiable   but encouraged

       "22   let s say you live at the end of an airport runway    large jetliners continuously pass over your house   rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace    let s say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances   and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home    now let s say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway   and offers you more than it s worth    wouldn t you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed    of course you would    but what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise   and the house your castle    that s what they are to darryl kerrigan   michael caton     and although he s happy that a multi national corporation would like to buy his home   sorry   it s not for sale    unfortunately   the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government   which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice    not about to take this lying down   darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto   tiriel mora   and makes a determined   albeit pathetic   attempt to fight back    the castle   an australian comedy by rob sitch   is perhaps one of the simplest movies i ve seen in recent memory   yet also one of the funniest    in fact   it is this film s reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful    the good guys and the bad guys are clear   the humor is straightforward   and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets    it s the perfect setup for a relaxing   hilarious good time   and as much as i hate to admit it   i liked the fact that i didn t have to think all that much while watching this film    i just sat back and enjoyed myself    the situation is one we ve seen before   regular joe fights back against the government   or big business   or whatever    what makes this film different is its characters    darryl thinks he s got the best life in the world   he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind   he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he s got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal   anne tenny     and he swells with pride when his son dale   stephen curry   digs a hole in the yard    steve kerrigan   anthony simcoe   constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for   investments   like jousting sticks and overhead projectors   while wayne kerrigan is in jail   as a result of dennis denuto s incompetent courtroom maneuvers    the great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren t so stupid that they get annoying    they re just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing    we look upon them with a little bit of pity   but a whole lot of affection    screenwriters sitch   santo cilauro   tom gleisner   and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate   further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans    sympathy for their situation   the laughter they bring us   and the family s wonderful characterization   simple as it may be   leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them    i suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans   but trust me   it works    i particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs    don t get me wrong   slapstick   when executed well   can be genius    it s just that too often   a film will resort to it s use as a shortcut to amusing the audience   not always successfully    instead   the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world    when they are by themselves   the are funny   and when they are with normal people   they are hilarious    one of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though    the kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film s running time    luckily   it s a funny little detour that   while slightly distracting from the film s main drive   is still quite enjoyable    with all the levity abound in the castle   the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept   that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property   an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes    i m not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life   but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution   of australia   and certainly sounds impressive at any rate    and   for that matter   it s more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this

       "23    soldier  is hands down one of the worst movies a person could ever have to sit through that doesn t have jean claude van damme in it    i could liken it to the sci fi cheese that was the hollywood product of choice back in the early 80s   but that would be too much of a compliment    if there is a movie theater in hell   this film is playing there 24 hours a day    the story   such that there is   revolves around todd   kurt russell     an automaton of a man who has been raised from birth to be a merciless soldier in a not too distant ultra conservative future   is there any other kind      after years of desensitization at a military academy full of other boys just like him   todd becomes a ground fighter in a series of wars all over the galaxy    who the enemies in these wars are is never revealed   but the few glimpses of todd in battle show that it doesn t matter   because innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys    after ten minutes of this nihilistic trash    yes folks   there s more    we see todd as a buff   scarred adult   now so accustomed to the carnage that no confrontation at all causes him to break a sweat    there s a new wrinkle   though    todd and his brethren are declared obsolete   and a new batch of soldiers takes their place    after losing a sanctioned battle with  dragon  s jason scott lee   the seemingly dead todd is dumped by a flying ice cube tray   well   that s what is looked like   on a remote garbage planet    if you predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet   and that they band together to fight a bunch of bad guys coming to destroy them   you re way ahead of the game    the renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you half expect tina turner and master blaster to come strolling into frame any minute    it s surprising that  soldier  is the brain child of  blade runner  co writer david webb peoples    unlike that mind twisting classic   this film contains just barely enough dialogue to fill about three double spaced pages    add into the mix the  mortal kombat  s paul anderson inept direction   and it s easy to see how  soldier  turned out so bad    and the special effects    remember the flying steam irons in hardware wars    gary busey is in this movie     nuff said     soldier  is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults    that this sad film made it to the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all    now if you ll excuse me   i have to go weep for the future

       "25   after a rather disappointing   mary railly     stephen frears is now officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise    this is one of the best surprises of this season    a sweet   small budget comedy with a big heart    in fact it s not even a comedy    it s a drama or even more precise    a clever satire on human relationships and needs    based on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby     high fidelity   is a wry and likable story about a man s quest for fulfillment and happiness    rob gordon was a dj    it seems that he could make everything spin    except his own life    now he owns championship vinyl   a little musical store   somewhere in new york    when he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend   a gorgeous blond attorney   life suddenly looses every purpose    decimated   humiliated and on the verge of a mental   and emotional   breakdown   he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been    about what s right and what s important    he starts   categorizing   life   dividing it into   top 5 lists      and the most important is the   top 5 list   over the most painful breakups of his life   starting with 5th grade   when he found his young girlfriend with another boy    though you might think that people change   grow more mature with age   it just doesn t seem that way and all rob s relationships were different versions of that first    where did he go wrong    was it he that screwed up    or maybe life just stinks    while he is lost in his own self pity   he must think of the   top 5 list   over his needs for the future   find the right elements and mix his life together    with clever parallels to the cult of celebrity   music and with incredibly direct narration   it addresses the average audience member   in other words    people like you and me    although a lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter        and frears   the director   the acting is equally important as the written word    and here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned    he is simply superb    it is as much his movie as it is frears     the film would not be the same without him    cusack    whose character is sadder   wiser and 35    brings intelligence and warmth to post  mod irony    most of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera    not an easy task    but cusack pulls it off    his interpretation feels so emotionally right   so incredibly realistic and precise that frears  message simply can t be ignored or overseen    the other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job    both        and jack black are fabulous    even catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actually acts   not just looks beautiful    however   the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as rob s co worker and friend dick    this is such an impressive achievement that it s almost worth a oscar nomination    he is simply a joy to behold    otherwise   everyone are in their place   and at the right time    all part of frears  colorful blend    pretty much like edward norton s   keeping the faith     this film doesn t follow any formula or belong to any genre    it s dramatic   tragic   sarcastic   comic and even cynical   but never bitter or angry    it s a little bit of everything   pretty much like life itself    nothing seems unreal or staged    it reflects reality as a mirror    as you watch it   you go through the same emotional problems as the main character    you feel and think and reflect    this effect has become a rarity nowadays    although it s primarily about the perils of love     high fidelity   is secondarily about pop music    rob owns championship vinyl and his employees   timid dick   todd louiso   and overbearing barry   jack black     are fellow music snobs    music is the language in their lives   the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant events of their lives    and so does the movie    it is as much a musical film as anything else   as rob s journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments    in the end   you have gained something while watching it    it s not the film of the century or even of the year    it s not an special effects extravaganza    it doesn t require big explosions or digital creatures to succeed    it s a small movie about the big things    and even though it does not contain heavy philosophy   you feel as if you have experienced something of significance   and you will experience that nice warm feeling for quite some time

       "26      last night   could have an   aka   tagged on the end of it that says     it s the end of the world   and we feel fine         last night   is about just that    the last night of planet earth s existence    the world is going to end at precisely midnight   january 1st   2000    how scientists were so accurately able to predict when this catastrophic event would occur is never explained    nor is the event itself    throughout the entire movie   no explanation is given as to why this is happening    in doing this   mckellar   who also wrote and directed the film   seems to be trying to transcend the genre    he s attempted to make a film about people   and how each of them deals with their last night of life    the film contains no science fiction elements   which allows the viewer to concentrate on the feelings and actions of the characters    mckellar is largely successful in his attempt to rise above his material    the film is set in toronto   and follows several people in their various escapades on the last night of existence    there s mckellar   who plays a man who just wants to be alone when the moment occurs   but keeps getting interrupted by a woman   sandra oh   in search of her husband    her husband   played by david cronenberg   is spending the day working at the gas company   informing people that they will attempt to keep providing gas right up until the end    finally   there s mckellar s friend   played by callum keith rennie   a man who has spent his final months trying out every sexual perversion you can think of    mckellar has crafted a gang of the some of the most interesting characters i ve seen in a film in months    these people all felt real to me   especially the character played by sandra oh    we can see her desperation   her utter need to be with her husband in the final hours    rennie is good   too   as the man who wants to literally try everything before he dies    he exudes such charm and likeablity   it s not surprising that we re rooting for him to get what he wants    but for me   the biggest surprise in the movie is mckellar    i knew that he was a talented director   but i had no idea he could act as well    his insistence to be alone   much to the dismay of his parents   is something that most people would find difficult to understand   but as played by mckellar   we can understand his reasons    he doesn t buy into the whole notion that just because everyone s going to die   he should immediately find some companionship    he realizes the relationship would be forced   and they would only be together for the sake of being together    mckellar gives a brilliant performance   and i hope he alternates between directing and acting    my only quibble with the film is that we never find out why the world is ending    i really wanted to know   and my need to know was hanging over the film at all times    i appreciate the fact that mckellar didn t want the material to rule the film   and that he wanted the movie to be more of a study in human behavious    however   in not telling the audience what the cause of earth s destruction is   he s left a big question that is in their minds throughout the film    another problem is we never see anybody panicking    i would imagine if the world was ending   and there was nothing to be done about it   a large segment of the population would be going out of their minds    instead   we are treated to shots of a giant crowd partying like it s new year s eve    i just didn t buy the fact that everyone had completely accepted their fate    no one had the urge to   rage against the dying of the light      despite these small problems     last night   is one of the best movies of the year    as opposed to the moronic

       "27   it has been 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters    his new film   the thin red line   is a strange   beautiful   enigmatic mess of a movie    the first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast    it is filled with above the title stars    the cast   for the most part   gives great performances    john travolta   whose role is nothing more than a cameo   seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve    george clooney   whose role became a cameo in editing   gives a strange performance    one wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a character s narration    the rest of the cast   especially nick nolte and elias koteas   are unambiguously fantastic    these actors   and they are   with two exceptions   men   were lured by the name of malick    terrence malick is a cinematic legend    he has often been called   the j   d   salinger of cinema      his two previous films   badlands and days of heaven   are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures    after he made them   he disappeared for 20 years    this film marks his return    what he s made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment    the narration which fills the film   and perplexes many   not only lets us hear the narrators   the characters themselves   pontificate   but also lets us hear such of the moment thoughts as   i m scared      the rather simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted    the plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill    a plot synopsis for the thin red line is difficult   because the story is fractured    many stories are here   from the clash between the lieutenant   elias koteas   and the savage colonel   a voracious nick nolte   to the private   ben chaplin   who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going    the fracturing of the story is ultimately a fault    it is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues and then threw them into a box   shook the box   and poured the results onto a table    this basically creates a mess   but the stories can be discerned and enjoyed    i m not declaring that the film has no structure    while saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot   malick uses reflection and glorious shots of nature to bookend about 90 minutes of combat    the battles in the thin red line are astonishing and display a mastery of filmmaking    the astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice    this film uses color and light in such a fantastic way   that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video    ultimately   malick has crafted a film that is a movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more than regarding the war that rages below them    the film is filled with nature photography and the regarding of nature    while some have said that the anti war message and pro nature tubthumping was juvenile   it was done with so much complexity and thought   that it cannot ever honestly be called childish    after seeing the thin red line   i was haunted by it and am quite ready to see it again

       "28   america loves convenience    after all   we re the culture that invented the cell phone   the 24 hour atm   and my most beloved   the remote control    yet perhaps this time   with ghosts of mars   we have taken our love of convenience to far    ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails   pill poppin    martian cop   sent with her squadron to retrieve   demolition   williams   ice cube   from a remote mining town for trial back home    when she and her comrades   appropriately dubbed   the commander       the rookies     and the guy with the cool accent discover the town s residents slaughtered   they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents  head chopping   alien possessed clutches    filled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks   flashes sideways   and viewpoint changes   ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill conceived action sequences    the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story    ripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie   ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next   stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose    attempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced    most of these moments come off as kwik e mart wisdom   dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even tempered streetwise hand of ice cube    with a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other   cube reminisces about his street life   comparing the zombie stomping fun to   me and my brother when we was kids      apparently   crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment    but   even in the film s darkest moments   fate conveniently lends a hand   supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite    yes   in the future   man may travel to space and conquer mars   but nothing beats a good stick of tnt    and as we all know   every police station   past   present   or future   keeps a healthy supply on hand    characters die   heads are lopped off   but they were only supporting roles anyway   so why should we care    as long as you have plenty of narcotics   immunity is guaranteed    eventually though   even the most well trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a lesson    what better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation   killing anything the machine guns can t handle    explosions are fun    and even if the nukes don t get them   the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will    in the end this film defines itself when our cop s tribunal pronounces     is that all you have to tell us      for   indeed   john carpenter has run out of things to say   and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story

       "29   you d think that after awhile hollywood would stop trying to make movies out of video games    it hasn t worked so far       street fighter         super mario brothers         wing commander         mortal kombat      not a watchable film in the bunch    still i held out some hope for   tomb raider      after all   the game s premise is heavily influenced by the indiana jones trilogy and all the mummy movies   so there are cinematic elements imbedded in the concept    however   despite the potential of the project     tomb raider   proves to be yet another bomb    the plot is a convoluted accumulation of nonsense probably borrowed from a dozen bad movies    there s a once ever 5000 years alignment of planets coming up   and the illuminati have to find both halves of an ancient triangle that controls time in order to take over the world    of course   the ancient folks who divided the triangle buried the halves in tombs on opposite sides of the world    our heroine   lady lara croft   angelina jolie     finds the key that opens the tombs in relics that her dead father   jon voight   dug up    she figures that if she gets the triangle   she can bring her dad back from the dead    of course   no one was expecting much of a plot from this movie anyway    in both video games and action movies   the plot is just an excuse for the action sequences    however   the action in   tomb raider   shows little style or originality    there s lots of shooting and some kung fu fightin    but none of it progresses beyond the level of a cheap direct to cable flick    the other goofy archeologist flick of the summer     the mummy returns     was much better   it had its flaws   but its action was creative and large scale    since winning her academy award for   girl   interrupted     jolie hasn t taken any projects that would display her acting talents       tomb raider   seems to be more interested in displaying her breasts   so much attention is drawn to them that it s a shame there s no oscar for best performance by a wonderbra    while we don t see much of her acting ability   with the exception of a wonderful upper crust british accent     we do get a hint of jolie s less savory side    considering the rumors of incest that hang over jolie and her supposed obsession with death   having lara be obsessed with resurrecting her dead father   and uninterested in any of the living males around her   seems a poor choice    having jolie s real life father jon voight play the dead dad makes it even creepier    i haven t decided what to make of director simon west yet    his first feature was the star studded disaster   con air     but my opinion of him improved with   the general s daughter     which was thick with sultry atmosphere    now this train wreck    i hope he improves again because his next project is the big screen version of the cult tv series   the prisoner      hollywood has already screwed up   the avengers     and   the prisoner   represents a chance for redemption       by the way   speaking of british tv     red dwarf   fans should look for chris   rimmer   barrie in his first major film role

       "469  earth is a harsh   unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent    people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict   as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets   indian and pakistani   muslim   hindu   sikh   parsee    the story takes place in lahore   which was indian before partition   and pakistani afterward   regardless of what its citizens might call themselves    the action is seen through the eyes of lenny   maaia sethna     a young parsee girl   but it is really about her nanny   shanta    shanta has a small circle of male admirers    two of the men are suitors   hasan   rahul khanna     a hindu   and dil navaz   aamir khan     a muslim    the others  sikh   hindu   muslim  are older   some are married   but all appreciate shanta   who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das       she also starred in deepa mehta s previous film   fire   the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water      in an early scene   the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny   political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears    one of the men remarks   jokingly   that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along    he is wrong   the men make barbed little comments to each other   spoken like jokes   but with an undercurrent of fanaticism    the tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses    it is easy to perceive   in these squabbles   the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter    the group around shanta represents   in a sense   a united india   and shanta herself the ideal motherland  one which all love   which inspires hindu   muslim   and sikh to live peacably together    but the circle around shanta is sundered   as is the state    a sikh is persecuted   hides   then flees    another man is murdered    the group of friends will not meet again    the movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction   a plate shattered on the floor   a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child   and   most brutally   when the tension escalates into violence   a man is held down   tied between two cars   and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles    it is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully    the crux of earth s plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz    his sisters are killed in brutal fashion   by hindus   because they are muslim    dil navaz seeks solace from shanta   and asks in desperation that she marry him    but she loves hasan   and tenderly refuses dil navaz s offer    the combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him   and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality   the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate    despite the things he later does   it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him   but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things    the conclusion  the consequence of dil navaz s transformation  is rather abrupt    the story earth tells does not end    it just stops    it is an appropriate finish   giving us closure would have imparted   at least on an aesthetic level   a sense of resolution   of satisfaction    but there was no resolution for india and pakistan  they have been at war   on a small or large scale   for decades    since the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation   it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus    there is no healing to be had   no closure   on any level   despite the needless   tacked on ending   with voice over narration from lenny as an adult   framing the story      earth is   in some ways   an unexceptional movie    it does not reinvent the wheel   following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas    but deepa mehta s directon is assured   and the issues she addresses run deep    earth does for india what movies like zhang yimou s to live and tian zhuangzhuang s the blue kite did for china   they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history    such films strike me as inherently valuable   even when flawed    they may be biased or inaccurate   but they bear the weight of human hardship   and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other   more inventive films   often lack    it is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries   the events shown may have happened decades ago   but they still touch a nerve    the issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year    in the near future   india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other    at the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen   after seeing earth   i have a much   much better understanding

       "470  my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love    i love ralph fiennes    i love uma thurman    i love sean connery    hell   i m even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw    i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago   and i ve been eagerly awaiting the film ever since    a few months into the summer   however   i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times   and that it had ended up in the mid august dumping ground    then   in this final week before its official release   i learned that it was not to be screened for critics    and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs    and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique    my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things    the film i saw today didn t even meet those expectations    this is a lousy   incoherent mess    i would slam it harder   if it weren t for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine   lovable actors    but sets are ultimately empty   and the performances are completely uninspired    that s the main problem with the avengers   for all it s hip hop flash and tidal waves   none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired    it s like a chore   a bland exercise in superhero film making    it also feels like its been cut to pieces   clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots    this is just plain depressing    the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show    frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i ve never watched an episode    i wasn t alive then    i don t even watch television now    i m very sorry that i don t have this perspective   but   judging from the reviews i ve already read   knowing the tv show just makes matters worse    i didn t know and love john steed and emma peel   and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles    i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film    based on what the film told me   i gather that steed   fiennes   is some kind of british super guy   somewhat like james bond     and that dr   peel   thurman   is just a really smart doctor   who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits    they are to work together   under mother s orders   mother is played by jolly jim broadbent   while his co conspirator   father   is played by the equally talented fiona shaw      it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather    his name is de wynter   connery      he is a crazy scottish guy    our heroes had better stop him   or else            the weather will keep getting colder until they   have to go to hell to warm up     one of the film s few funny lines      along the way there is subplot after subplot   hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere   feel perfunctory   and ultimately make no sense    for example   our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos    now   killer bugs don t really go with the weather controlling theme of the film    the purpose of the bugs   other than to annihilate our heroes   is never established    they re never even directly connected to de wynter   they re controlled by his crazy henchman   played by eddie izzard      the special effects aren t bad   but they re loud   obnoxious   and intrusive    like so many scenes in the film   it seems present only to keep your attention from waning    and i guarantee you   it will wane    i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn t do any good to think    the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn t tell us what happens    there are several scenes in the preview that didn t make the final cut    in addition   many of the sequences have irritating   grainy film quality   which makes it feel low budget   the last scene is particularly bad      the scenes that don t feature action should be electric   thanks to our wonderful cast    they aren t    the action scenes should be electric   because this is an action film    they aren t   either    and what about this wasted cast    oh   it makes me weep with disappointment    we re talking ralph fiennes here   one of the best actors working today   one of the best actors   ever      i love the guy    i ve loved all his films   until this one    he seems like he wants to understand the film   but he s as lost as we are    and thurman   in all of her spectacular beauty and talent   can t manage to look at home here       i don t blame her completely   for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way   and it can t be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting      connery   however   seems the most out of it   totally lacking any kind of focus   or interest   for that matter    who is to blame    is it the screenwriter   don macpherson    perhaps   although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right    is it the actors    for god s sake   no    these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling    i blame director jeremiah chechik   who shouldn t have been given the task to begin with    his best film   benny   joon   is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be   but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor    add to that a lack of experience in big budget action   and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory    if the avengers has a saving grace   it s the set design    the sets   by stuart craig   are big   colorful   and often pleasing to look at    i like the final set piece   on de wynter s island   even if none of it makes a bit of sense    i admired the overhead view of the stairs   showing dr   peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere    i also enjoyed michael kamen s music score   particularly in the opening credits    but this stuff is routine    good sets and music are nice   but there s a lot more that needs to be here    inspiration   for instance   would have been really nice    maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story    or a sense of purpose    most of all   though   i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles    damn this movie for not giving them the chance

       "471  screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker    screenplay by andrew kevin walker    inspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving    directed by tim burton    starring johnny depp   christina ricci   and casper van dien    special appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken    synopsis   investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation    townspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them    cute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery    comments   tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years    batman   of course   is perhaps his best known film and led to a string of less successful sequels    he s done biographical work   on the director ed wood     children s movies   nightmare before christmas     and a homage to alien invasion movies   mars attacks        sleepy hollow   his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while   shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies    sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s   especially hammer studios  reworkings of dracula and frankenstein   and american international s series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe    christopher lee   in fact   star of many hammer productions over the years   appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders    the movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s    one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein    i mention these allusions for a reason    seasoned horror film fans   including myself   will smile at their inclusion in this film    with the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies   especially the blair witch project   the most overblown turkey of the decade     we needed a film like this    not only does it have a sense of history   but burton s skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror    the film s eerie landscapes and foggy towns   indeed   overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie    johnny depp   a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands   plays ichabod crane   who has apparently changed occupations from irving s original story and is now an investigator    depp is adequate in his role    no more   no less    equally adequate is christina ricci   who plays the love interest in the film    she s a good witch too    how cute    one of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters    the two actors   however   carry the movie well enough   but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine    veteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough   who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks   are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers    while i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points   i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing    you have to pay attention    andrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay    he s the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven    walker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood   and sleepy hollow certainly doesn t hurt his growing reputation    as one might imagine from a gentleman like walker   sleepy hollow is quite graphic    there s a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings    this is definately not a flick to take the young kids to    a lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25   30 minutes covering the youngest s eyes with her hand    he was obviously upset by the movie s intense violence    if you re looking for a good scare   however   sleepy hollow is definately recommended

       "472  the characters in jonathan lynn s   the whole nine yards     yet another in an endless recent string of mob comedies   1999 s   analyze this   and   mickey blue eyes     2000 s   gun shy       are rarely ever written as real people   but merely as one dimensional caricatures    when an added layer to one of their personalities is revealed   it is not to service the character development   or to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations   but to accommodate the convoluted plot    in a lightweight comedy   you might say   it is not required to have perfectly realized figures   just as long as they get the job done    unfortunately   for a comedy to work   it has to at least succeed at being funny   and if there was a laugh o meter available   i d guess that it briefly ascended around 2   5  of the time for me    suffice to say   the comedy in   the whole nine yards   works about as well as the broken down lawnmower in my backyard   and when a giggle surprisingly arises every twenty to thirty minutes   it is by sheer luck    nicholas   oz   oseransky   matthew perry   is an amateur dentist living in the quiet suburbs of quebec    trapped in a hateful marriage with the conniving sophie   rosanna arquette   delightfully hamming it up with a clearly artificial french canadian accent     one day oz sees that someone is moving into the house next door    walking over to greet him   he is horrified to discover it is jimmy   the tulip   tudeski   bruce willis     a former contract killer for the mafia who has just been released from prison    once getting to know him and becoming his friend   oz is more comfortable with his identity   but for sophie   it means a possible hitman to do away with oz    in her scheme   sophie sends oz to chicago to cash in by informing his old mob boss   kevin pollak   about jimmy s whereabouts   but in the process   he falls in love with jimmy s wife   cynthia   natasha henstridge     who is being held hostage    upon return to quebec   and with one contrivance after the next   oz s dental assistant   jill   amanda peet     is overjoyed to discover that he lives beside   the tulip     and forces him to set up a meeting   since jill s dream in life turns out being a contract killer herself    have you got all that    because there is more    much   much more    and this is a movie that   without credits   is little over 90 minutes and feels only like an hour       the whole nine yards   is an ultimately unsatisfying and empty headed excursion into well worn terrain already set by far superior pictures    how the cast   most of which are respectable actors   got caught up in such a cliched   deficient film remains a mystery   unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynn s 1985 comedy classic     clue   the movie      going into the theater   preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable   but by the twenty minute mark   when i had chuckled once and laughed nary a single time   it was clear this production was in serious trouble    since the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot   and the screenplay   inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner   collapses with every failing   comedy   bit   the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance and   frequently   entertainment value       the whole nine yards   is neither facetious nor   aside from the subplot about jill s shocking eagerness to become a professional hitwoman   inventive   and more often than not   just lies there   the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector   but never igniting any sort of spark    a few select actors do what they can with the material   while others make no impact at all    on the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters   matthew perry and bruce willis    perry   innocuously enjoyable on tv s   friends     plays the same exact sitcom style character in all of his movies   from 1997 s   fools rush in   to 1999 s   three to tango       and it has become a crushing bore    meanwhile   willis makes next to no impression   and because of the limited guise of his jimmy   the tulip   tudeski   oftentimes disappears into the background    their three female counterparts fare noticeably better    best of all is natasha henstridge   far more radiant than in the exploitative   species   movies   who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to cynthia    henstridge has the talent   for sure   to break out of these countless throwaway roles   but first she must fire her agent    amanda peet has a lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward and giddy jill   and seems to know more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who   thus far   has strived on a career based solely on comedy    it is too bad   then   that peet is unnecessarily asked to disrobe in a climactic scene   with the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts    finally   rosanna arquette is awful as sophie   but something tells me that was her purpose   and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time    also popping up is michael clarke duncan   fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in   the green mile     as jimmy s largely built friend and fellow killer   frankie figs    when   the whole nine yards   eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion   one is left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit    a great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past   and this one is nothing but a duplication of better films   so what was the point    without a passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments     the whole nine yards   rests solely on the presumed charm of the cast   and half of the actors are not charming at all    now   what does that tell you

       "473  actually   i m fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie       baywatch   babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her double d s on the small screen    at least there you don t have to pay to see her cleavage    and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless   hate to burst your bubble   but there are no full fledged nude scenes in barb wire    you wouldn t be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in    i can t go back in time and reverse my mistake   but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there    they do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude   it s so quick you can t even tell for sure whether you re seeing her andersons or not    a nipple hallucination sort of thing    barb wire was adapted from a comic book   interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life   even wearing low cut leather to do office work   businesswoman bondage wear   and having unreal body proportions    yes   like the mona lisa   pamela anderson is a man made beauty   probably in more senses than one    she is a definite beauty   though   and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience    you d just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldn t have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie   because it s obvious she wasn t pulling a sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills    i mean   she shows off more cleavage here than a jeweler s convention    the movie is set in the year 2017     the worst year of my life     pam says         the worst movie of the year     i say      america is going through a second civil war and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation   silicone valley   i think      she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right   posing as first a stripper and later as a prostitute    but don t call her   babe      she hates that   and reminds us of that fact way too many times    imagine   a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar while having a hose sprayed on her being referred to in such a sexist   demeaning term    a liberated woman like pamela anderson shouldn t have to hear words like   babe   during a strip tease   especially since that movie about the talking pig was such a success    the plot   ha ha   revolves around a pair of contact lenses that allow their wearer to pass through the congressional directorate s retina scanners    in the words of one of the characters   they re   more than meets the eye      reminds me of the   transformers   cartoon   and i sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent   but that never happened    no   the movie just continued on its path of lame action scenes starring pamela van damme   big busted kickboxer   and her resistance accomplices   ex boyfriend axel   tamuera morrison   and cora   victoria rowell      thank god they didn t name her cora reef    one bad character name is more than enough    pamela originally doesn t take sides   giving some speech about she s only loyal to the money they pay her   but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother   jack noseworthy of bon jovi   always   video fame    i still don t know if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy   but he definitely is nose worthy   even if he isn t sponge worthy      pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semi automatic weapons and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest    it s not rambo        it s bimbo    mark my words   barb wire will be all over the cinemax network in a year    it s got all the elements of the direct to video releases featured on hbo s bastard cousin   the cable channel i d never watch if it didn t somehow come free    it s got the non titillating scenes of voyeurism   laughable flashbacks   bad dialogue and action cliches out the wazzoo    there s even a narrator at the beginning setting up the movie s premise while the words scroll up the screen    someone needs to tell pamela the wookie this ain t star wars    if you ve seen any action flick of the past fifteen years   you ll recognize plenty of lifted elements    barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over   car crashes   explosions   broken glass and slow motion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet to their death    this is one of those automatic pilot movies anyone could write or direct    barb wire has only two things going for it        and i think you know what those two things are

       "474  you don t need to have seen the original   species   to appreciate how utterly lousy   species ii   is    with few exceptions   sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them   but the fact that   species ii   is a follow up isn t the only reason it s so miserable    it s the predictable storyline   the cardboard characters   the banal dialogue   the failed attempts at humor   the revolting special effects   the gratuitous nudity   all female   of course     the bad acting   and the bland direction    the plot   simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc   involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle    the slime   well   sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black    that should have been the end of the movie right there    back on terra firma   at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and   as you ll remember if you saw the first movie   driven by a strong urge to procreate    on a parallel track   government scientists have cloned a version of sil from the first film   now called eve   again   played   by natasha henstridge   and are keeping her around for some testing    this   apparently   includes observing eve s reaction to   the dukes of hazzard   tv show   which she appears to enjoy    eve s bio rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk   mates     which we are forced to witness in gross out detail   but otherwise there doesn t appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film   unless it was written into her contract   let s hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only      eve finally breaks free of her confines  and her bra  for the finale   but the effects are so messy you can t really see what s going on    peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams   i told  em not to go      at the top of his lungs   referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle    michael madsen reprises his role of press lennox   so that he can enter high security areas   flash a badge and claim to be press   maybe       as does marg helgenberger as dr   laura baker   the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns    they re both unbelievably wooden    what s a talented filmmaker like peter medak     the ruling class       the krays       let him have it     doing directing this tripe   i wonder    it s an unfortunate trend   this   once talented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like   species ii      last year peter hyams gave us   the relic     no thanks necessary there    and the first   species   was helmed by roger donaldson who   although certainly no genius behind the camera   had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects    is it just that there are no better offers out there       species ii   is worthless    worse than that   it s also exploitative   offensive   and insulting to the intelligence at every turn    it s not that there isn t anything positive to say about the film    there is    after 92 minutes   it ends

       "475  this review contains spoilers   but believe me   i don t say anything you can t guess 10 minutes into the movie    i   did   go into this one with high expectations    i had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks    i sort of expected another exorcist or the shining    i even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film    boy   was i wrong    another garbage slasher flick   the only difference being that   this   one has a story    the story   you ask    well   a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk    he takes it home   somehow getting it past customs       and starts fiddling with it in his attic    lo and behold   after he takes it apart   three demons appear and start taking him apart   but with meat hooks    when they re finished   his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling    they botch up their cleanup job   however   and manage to leave his heart   or some gland   i didn t really recognize the organ   under a floorboard    the guy s brother and his brother s wife appear at the door soon after   and decide to move in    they throw away scumball s belongings   and set up house    turns out that wife is a bit of a nympho   and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage    she starts having some wild hallucinations    later   hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards   slow mo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the ground  all from the tiny cut on his hand      said blood is eagerly sucked up by scumball s organ    the organ grows into a thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing    it establishes mind contact with wife   who agrees to help him get more blood   because she really wants to be screwed again    so   she helps him kill three businessmen    scumball   at this time   gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back    problem is   he doesn t have any skin   and even after three or four corpses   still doesn t get any skin    he finally gets some   though   but strangely enough   he ends up looking like his brother    guess they couldn t get the original actor back    who knows    scumball   whose name is frank   is not a nice guy    he describes his torture by the demons fondly   as the   ultimate pleasure and pain   since at that level there is no difference between the two      somehow   i don t see getting torn apart by 90 fish  and meat hooks a lot of fun    this guy is   so   bad     how bad   is   he             so   bad that the   rats   cower in a corner in fear    for good reason   too   he crucifies two of them for fun   and carves a third while the nympho s horsing around with hubby    anyway   hubby s daughter   who   if course   is not   wife s   daughter   starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one of her johns and the ensuing screams    the dumb bimbo meets scumball   and is not impressed    she manages to escape with the chinese puzzle   and brings out the demons    at any rate   the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup   they re normally quite meticulous about that type of thing    the story boils down to the demons trying to correct their mistake    the demons are not   however   the good guys    the dumb bimbo s the good guy    she somehow not only gets them to take care of frank   but also banishes them to hell or oblivion   we re not too sure which    not too shabby for someone with single digit iq    this is basically a   bad jinn   story    it is an   awful   movie    awful acting   bad focus in the photography   many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks   which is really unrealistic   and looks like the latex that it is    continuity    who cares    acting       terrible      script    horrible    sounds canned    unrealistic    story is so so   but the impact is lost long   long before the film ends    i do think the   rat   acting was quite good    i have never seen rats look afraid    they should get nominated for an award    really good acting there   the best in the movie       the envelope for best furry rodent   please          a     rating would be far too generous    a   1 10   rating   or  4 in the  4 to  4 rating system   is far more accurate    this movie is so bad that people in the audience were laughing   chortling at the bad acting and crummy dialog    i can see this film turning into the next rocky horror picture show    people were getting so fed up they were yelling warnings up to the characters on the screen    had to have something to do    dumb   dumb   dumb movie    i was embarrassed that i spent money to see it    it goes without saying that i disagree with the other reviews on the board that attempt to review the film for itself    lots of slime and red dyed corn syrup does not constitute   horror     in my opinion

       "476  there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space   it s just that none of them happen to be actors    the stars i m referring to are the computer generated ones that make up the movie s   outer space     the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home    yes   in terms of acting   the star power is            well   more like a falling star    kinda pretty   short lived   and pretty much dead    lost in space   as if you really didn t know   is based on the 60 s sci fi television series of the same name    it s the year 2058   and earth s precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population    john robinson   william hurt   is the scientist leading a mission program to colonize a foreign planet    earth s entire existance is contingent upon a successful mission   but nobody   whether it be john s family or hired battle pilot don west   matt leblanc     seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years    john s family consists of his wife maureen   mimi rogers     his atypical teenage daughter penny   lacey chabert     his ingenious son will   jack johnson     and his beautiful scientist daughter judy   heather graham      despite everyone s reluctance   the jupiter 2 spacecraft abandons planet earth and makes its way into the vast eternity of space    unknown to anyone but the audience   there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage the entire mission    dr   smith   gary oldman   has been hired by a group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour   and dr   smith has re programmed a talking robot to   destroy robinson family      when everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides   the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination   and now the premise of being lost in space is complete    as for the audience   you will likely be lost in boredom by this point   wondering if the plot   like the jupiter 2   will ever get off the ground    it s hard to tell who deserves the most blame   the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script    chabert is basically the only one to overdo it   sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium    if you   like me   were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens   you re wrong    that s just her normal voice    in yet another example of a   friend   faltering on the big screen   leblanc is so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming   make sense       it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod    graham is a babe   thank goodness there was something for me to think about during this film    hurt   the black hole of excitement   sucks up any energy that might have been left    if hurt were available in tablet form   he would be a prescription strength sleeping pill    johnson isn t dull   he s just lame as the young know it all who winds up saving everybody s ass all the time    want an example of how cool this kid can be    how about when he convinces the robot to think with its heart and reconsider killing the family    hey   don t laugh   the thing actually listened to the mr   rogers would be proud sentiment    but alas   if you thought a character couldn t be much worse   there was rogers as the epitome of generic   or   mother as she was known      why hire an actress    they could ve had a white cardboard cutout with the word mom printed on it    now that would ve had some pizzazz    lost in space luckily doesn t suffer in every single category that it could have    the special effects are crisp   clear   and at least mildly captivating   unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman   who plays his evil character with a great deal of fun and finesse    unfortunately   oldman is locked away for most of the film   giving us nothing but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy    while the special effects are pleasing to the eye   they are nothing you couldn t find in most modern sci fi films    contact   for example   far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination    lost in space just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work of cinematic art   with numerous contradictions   the time travel aspect was horribly flawed       wooden and corny acting   worse dialogue   and an ending so disappointing   you d be happier to have seen the entire robinson family get blown to smithereens    then again   with an ending like this film has   it s obvious a sequel is already being considered    what an awful note to end on   knowing there could be more of this in a year or two    the attempt to be family oriented is commendable   but lost in space is lost with the illusion that special effects and the nostalgia of a classic tv series being revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups    well   danger potential movie goers    danger    this movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity

then it gets worse   literally raining frogs    yes   frogs    assuming it to be an intended deus ex machina device   it is an ineffective one because it doesn t seem to faze the characters much    oh   they may step gingerly around the splattered frog corpses littering the streets   but otherwise   the frog shower didn t seem to change their behavior or pattern of living   or dying      there is simply too much going on in this movie and most of it is distasteful to watch    mr   anderson further obscures the film by incorporating a loud and intrusive sound track that often drowned out the dialogue   a character who apparently rapped a significant clue to a plot development which was completely unintelligble   and a heavy handed segment of   historical   occurances containing ironic twists which set up absolutely nothing    one of the recurring themes is found in a line donnie quotes     we may be done with the past   but the past is not done with us      this is an absolute lie

       "478  steven spielberg s second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film    spielberg   ever the student on film   has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest   and most powerful entries    he also managed to cast this era s greatest answer to jimmy stewart   tom hanks   who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle    for about 160 out of its 170 minutes     saving private ryan   is flawless    literally    the plot is simple enough    after the epic d day invasion   whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular     capt   john miller   hanks   and his team are forced to search for a pvt    james ryan   damon     whose brothers have all died in battle    once they find him   they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home    accompanying miller are his crew   played with astonishing perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational    barry pepper   adam goldberg   vin diesel   giovanni ribisi   davies   and burns are the team sent to find one man   and bring him home    the battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary    literally    there is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the film s first 20 minutes    spielberg films almost the entire movie without music   leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion   and they do to perfection    the sequences in france   all of them   beginning with the battle and ending with the battle   are fabulous   especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides   trying to save private ryan    there are no words i can use to describe the true horror and power of these sequences    this is what coppola was looking for in   apocalypse now     but couldn t create    the sheer horror of these sequences all but condemn war    the performance by hanks as the leader of this gang is also extraordinary    he is head and shoulders above of the rest of the actors in the world   with his comic timing   dramatic flair   his quiet emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears    hanks is this country s finest actor   and he proves it here    however   spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece    with a chance to make it the one of the greatest films of all time   spielberg creates 10 minutes of purely worthless film    the sequence involving army chief of stafff george marshall and mrs   ryan is decent   but doesn t hold up to the rest of the film   relying on wartime cliches to power it    but that is forgivable    what isn t is the bookends of the film   the cemetary sequences    the first one is quite good   a decent introduction into the lives of these men    the last sequence is atrocious    the forced emotion   accompanied by a ridiculous piece of music   is simply horrible compared to the rest of the magical film    these flaws are what downgrade   ryan   from the greatest film of our era   to the greatest war film of our era    spielberg should have trusted his own material   and he should have trusted hanks to deliver the most chilling line of the movie   to end his masterpiece right there    the use of the flag   though patriotic   is in contrast to the movie s theme    the power of the bulk of the film   however   is astonishing    spielberg has truly made a wondrous work of art   that persists even after first viewing of the film   is extraordinary    this is the film of the year

       "479  i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film    i bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying     it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday   and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach    throw in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof    we ll have a hit on our hands      the replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film   a mishmash collage of one dimensional characters   rampant stereotypes of cultures and races   cliched emotional statements of purpose   and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography    the story is loosely based around the pro football players  strike in 1987 and a rag tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels    keanu reeves stars as shane falco   a has been football college player looking for redemption    gene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers    rounding out the cast includes swingers  jon favreau   7 up pitchman orlando jones   gruff owner jack warden   and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters   the drunken welshman   the overweight sumo wrestler   the black convict   the violent cop   and the dumb   dumb cheerleaders    this bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays   gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is   keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field   and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny s    the usual things happen like clockwork    the hero rises from the ashes of failure   the team comes together in unity   the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest   the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap   and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax    it s also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks    howard deutch   who was behind the camera for two of the best films of  80s   pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful   has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes    obviously the problem is that without a good script   any director will fail in the end    sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory   gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds   the rise and fall of gallant heroes   and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life    the replacements offers none of this

       "480  in 1987 the stock market crashed   and oliver stone s wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses    wall street lucked out in its timing   the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had   and though its kill or be killed approach to business was exaggerated   that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan era businessman    stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs   evil tale relayed in the fast paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange    critics and audiences lauded wall street   elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic    i m proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them    i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone s output with its thin caricatures   obvious sentiments   and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen    stone goes for broke in every scene   the same could be said for nearly all of his works      this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions    he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane    it s all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity   rather than explore what these situations are really like    i have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative   as they are presented in boiler room   rather than laughably over the top    these guys are salesmen after all   not televised judges    more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street    the only possible solution i can muster is its release date    and not just the timeliness of the   greed is good   subject matter   the film was plumped down in the eighties   a decade in which the one joke comedy rose to an art form   and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept   low result movies    in my mind   the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies   but bad music   bad hair   and bad clothes    maybe stone s after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace    boiler room is an equally well timed film with some similarities to stone s piece of crap    they both feature a consequential father son relationship   though boiler room s is much more subtle and touching    and they are both concerned with the power of greed   yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery smooth   heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street    boiler room is a message movie as well   though   at least until the end   doesn t shove it in our faces    boiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash    as i said   this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day   bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn t been seen in quite a while     not only do we want to be millionaires   we want to watch other people become millionaires    in our super judgmental   power oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything   when you have money   you have it   all      and seth   giovanni ribisi   wants it   all   the easy way    he s a well intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm   the kind that sells junk stock   whereupon he meets others just like him    ben affleck is cast as jim   the company headhunter   who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko    his job is to influence trainee s into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood    it s ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b   s that they re told to dish out to prospective buyers    affleck s character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin s similar character in glengary glen ross   and that proves detrimental to the actor s performance    affleck shouts   curses and be littles his rookie employees just like baldwin   minus the edge    when alec played the scene he became the part   spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own    by comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading    the brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks   they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game    rap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are   intellectual gangsters    they aren t above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes    we drink up this world along with seth   and watch him become seduced by it   just like we might be    as in all cautionary tales   boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing   then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness    i know this story    we all do    but it can work if it s told with intelligence and energy   and that is how writer   director ben younger tells it    as a director of   please excuse my french   mise en scene younger has much to learn    his style is sitcom bland    but his writing isn t    younger s script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch   his dialogue is like a junior david mamet    despite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script    the brokers   hucksters counter every customer objection   gently bullying them into buying stock    these moments are filmed like psychological action scenes   a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isn t aware that he is one    with the exception of affleck s brief appearances   the performances are truly exceptional    ribisi   who has the edgy looks of a character actor   is extremely potent here   working his pale angular face   and eerie   plaintive stare for all their worth    he conveys child like vulnerability   his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things aren t going his way   in some scenes   and in others he s ferociously cut throat    the jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie   ribisi is confident when it s just him and the phone   but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father   authoritatively played by ron rifkin      boiler room thankfully avoids wall street like histrionics in the sales pitch sequences   the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys    those ploys are taught to seth by chris   vin diesel     a kind broker who alternates between seth s friend and his mentor    diesl shines in his minor role    this week i saw the sci fi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner    in that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80 s   and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 70 s    nicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he can t have    nia long   as the firm s secretary     a lone black women amongst many white men   is ribisi s love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets   but develops into something more interesting    the two make an oddly likeable couple    long is smart and brash   and ribisi is charmingly aloof    at one point he says to her   i m just lookin  for some chocolate love      it s a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child like way   it becomes sweetly endearing    unfortunately   towards the end   the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy    there is much crying   hugging   and sorrowful stares    this is okay when taken in small doses   but younger s conclusion is constructed as a series of these boo hoo moments   one following the other    a particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seth s manipulations have on one of his poor victims    it s not a bad idea but the execution is lacking   with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message    that message being     greed is bad      yes it s patently obvious   but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i haven t seen much of in the movies   the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur    and all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners    boiler room offers neither extreme    it gives us what is in between   and for that i am thankful      \n",
       "481  walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century fox s anastasia    but judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios   the visuals are the only thing fox has to brag about    disney s recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas   the hunchback of notre dame   and to a lesser extent   hercules    with anastasia   fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window    some may say   so what    it s just a kid s movie    well        if you have young kids   beware   as they may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of a corpse rotting rasputin zombie   whose body parts continually fall off in a disconcertingly real way    consider yourselves warned    nevertheless   the animation is quite stunning at times    don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout   occasionally rivalling photographic quality    and yet in other scenes   the hand drawn material seems of the saturday morning tv crowd   which leads me to wonder        was this rushed to market to combat disney    the plot   as anyone who had read history before knows   concerns the attempt to return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in 1916    not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened    as for the plot     go rent disney s candleshoe    you ll see 60  of anastasia there

       "482  inspired by the 1958 film house on haunted hill starring vincent price    directed by william malone    starring geoffrey rush   famke janssen   and chris kattan    rated r   contains violence   profanity   and brief nudity      synopsis   eccentric millionaire price offers  1   000   000 to each of his guests who appear at a gathering at a former sanitarium    the only catch is that they have to survive the night at the establishment   an establishment haunted by its former staff and patients    comments   house on haunted hill is based upon the original 1958 film of the same title directed by william castle and starring vincent price    in an obvious homage   the millionaire s name is price and he sports a thin mustache like price used to have    this is a pretty bad horror film   yet bad horror films sometimes are very entertaining   and house on haunted hill is just such a film    it is   surprisingly   better than another recent haunted house remake   the haunting   a film which owes its basis to the classic horror novel by shirley jackson    the haunting had literary pretensions and fell flat on it face    house on haunted hill owes its lineage to a b movie 40 years old and makes no illusion that it s a crappy horror movie    thus   somehow   it proves slightly more successful    i can t think of another recent film which has had such an eclectic cast    it is this cast which lifts this ho hum thriller into a borderline entertaining exercise in camp horror    price   the main character   is played by geoffrey rush   the academy award winning actor of shine    rush seems to be making a downward spiral in the movie industry   a spiral reminiscent of ben   ghandi   schindler s list   kingsley s ridiculous appearance in the camp sci fi classic species    i don t know why   but sometimes it s entertaining to see   quality   actors in bad movies    more surprises    rising star taye diggs plays a stereotypical african american sports figure   rather lamely too     and singer lisa loeb        appears as a tv news reporter    the highlight of the cast   however   has to be saturday night live member chris kattan    kattan s comic sense provides several good humorous moments as he plays the hysterical proprietor of the former sanitarium    while the first half of the film leaves the audience guessing as to what s exactly going on   the second half dissolves into standard ghost story stuff and loses some of its suspense    a disappointingly cheesy ending really mars this movie too    house on haunted hill   i suspect   has just about left the second run theaters    it s worth catching on cable next year   if you get a chance    if you have a choice   pick this movie over the haunting   it s the better of two evils   you could say    though   more appropriately perhaps   it d be better to say that it s the better of two turkeys

cultural vocabulary   and one of the more stomach turning ones    i ve never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers   and because of that i had apprehensions about seeing henry    i wasn t sure i wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic hero antihero    thankfully   that s not the way henry works    the director   john mcnaughton   took a small budget and a gallery of actor friends and created a chilling and intelligent piece of work    it doesn t provide cheap jack explanations for henry s behavior   it shows him up for what he is   an unrepentant and un idolizable man who killed when the mood struck him    at the film s opening   henry s friend ottis toole has a sister   who comes by to stay while she tries to find work in chicago    in a viciously riveting scene   he admits matter of factly to having murdered his own mother   and she covers his hand with hers    they are damned together from that moment on    henry and ottis eventually begin to kill for fun    the movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it   there s a scene where the two go to buy a new tv    the pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words   and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with a soldering iron    no preface    it smashes into us as suddenly as it does the broker    in a scene which many damned the movie for   unseen   they steal a video camera and film the murder of a whole household   playing it back over and over again for their own enjoyment    the movie itself   however   does not glorify the killings   but shows instead that henry feels no joy at his work   only irritation    henry succeeds thanks to excellent writing and direction as well as acting    michael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame   just standing there   and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as well    the producers had originally comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton   but he decided to give them something more memorable   and consequently the film nearly didn t see release    the film does not glorify or justify    it just shows us   with unflinching coldness   what henry was    i m hard pressed to see how anyone can see this and consider henry any kind of   victim   or   hero      then again   probably   so would henry

       "484  blatantly borrowing elements from 1993 s   like water for chocolate   and 1991 s   the butcher s wife       simply irresistible   attempts to be a whimsical romantic comedy but   more often than not   comes off as laughable   leaving you to wonder why rising star sarah michelle gellar   t   v    s   buffy   the vampire slayer     would choose such an obviously inept film project to waste her time on    things get off to a bad start right from the onset as amanda   sarah michelle gellar     a young woman who runs her late family s struggling new york restaurant   runs into a mystery man who forces a bushel of crabs on her and then vansihes into thin air    while out shopping   she also meets tom   sean patrick flanery     a charming   handsome man   who happens to be planning a ritzy restaurant for the department store he works for   and later when he decides to drop by her dive   called southern cross   for lunch   she somehow makes a delicious crab dish for him   even though she is known to not be a very good chef    suddenly   amanda finds her restaurant   on the edge of foreclosure   rejuvenate to life as customer begin to swarm for her food   which strangely causes everyone immediate jubilation when it hits their mouths    are amanda and tom destined to be together    and is it not just because of the magical food   but because they really   truly like each other    and what exactly is going on with the food she is making    does it have anything to do with that pesky crab she got that sits on the shelf in the kitchen somehow assisting her in her food preparation       simply irresistible   is a ridiculous and just plain goofy romantic fantasy that s as flimsy as a slice of bologna    it takes one joke   that people who eat the food are taken aback by it in most unusual ways   and recycles it over and over again until the film has reached an appropriate running time of 95 minutes    add in a music montage every ten minutes   these are actually the best scenes in the movie   which certainly tells you something about the film itself     and what you ve got is an utterly empty   if not necessarily boring   excursion    the cast of   simply irresistible   is fairly good   but it is the supporting characters who are the most interesting    patricia clarkson   1998 s   high art     in which she played a drugged out lesbian   is a standout as tom s colleague   and is thankfully given a few funny lines of dialogue    also of note is larry gilliard jr     as amanda s cooking assistant and buddy   who is allowed to create a seemingly full character out of only a handful of scenes    of the main stars   sarah michelle gellar is fine   but really does often look like she s struggling through the unmistakably clumsy material   and if sean patrick flanery plans on keeping a film career in the future   he has certainly got to pick better projects than this    the bottom line is that   simply irresistible   is the exact opposite of its deprophesized title   and when the movie got to the point where the characters began to float in mid air   an unamusing plot device that was repeated in the stupid last scene     my mind checked out from the characters and the romance    when i think about it in hindsight   i should have checked out in the very first scene   where the point of the action was for gellar to

       "485  the general s daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we ll see this year    or perhaps the stupidest clever film    it s confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction    that   however   is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller    the punched up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general s daughter has a brain in its head   even as the remaining 75  of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense    our hero is warrant officer paul brenner   a brash investigator for the u   s   army s criminal investigation division    his latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell   leslie stefanson   at a georgia base   the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation    complicating the case is the fact that capt   campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell   james cromwell     a war hero and potential vice presidential nominee    general campbell wants to keep the case out of the press   which gives brenner only the 36 hours before the fbi steps in    teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill   madeleine stowe      who   coincidentally enough   once had a romantic relationship with brenner    brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captain s past that make the case ever more sordid    if only the sordidness were the worst of the general s daughter s problems    scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary   their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered light sleaze    director simon west likely thinks he s covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers   but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches   which is the film s fatal flaw    it s a trend he continues for two hours   taking the story s few virtues and slapping a coat of moron proof obviousness over them    characters who may   wink wink   turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow   cutaway inserts of the captain campbell s still living face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five minute attention spans    west just can t help himself from overdirecting every minute of the general s daughter    he even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slow fade edits    bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell    the slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbell s mentor   a psychological warfare expert named moore   james woods      there s something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another    indeed   travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures   to the local sheriff of the georgia county     shouldn t you be out night sticking the colored folk          even the lame device of brenner and sunhill s sexual history provides a few winning zingers    goldman s dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than you ll find in most so called comedies    dialogue   unfortunately   just isn t enough to make a quality script    it s difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner   an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene   and too lucky for it to last any longer   not one but two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye      by the time the general s daughter wanders towards its over wrought   psycho in the rain finale   west s heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun    it s silly and pretentious film making   but at least it provides a giggle or five    goldman should tear the 15 decent pages out of this script and turn them into a stand up routine

       "486  susan granger s review of   jeepers creepers     mgm ua entertainment    this nasty   little horror film begins as a bickering brother   justin long   and sister   gina philips   are driving through the desolate countryside on their way home from college and spy a man dropping wrapped up bodies down a drainage pipe    when long decides to investigate   there s nothing but trouble       you know the part in scary movies where somebody does something really stupid and everybody hates them for it      well   this is it      philips warns    what he finds in the basement of an old   abandoned church is a dying boy with a horrifying   jagged stitched incision from his neck to his navel   plus hundreds of other mutilated bodies   stitched together on the walls and ceiling like a disgusting tapestry    long flees but now the monstrous   winged creeper   jonathan breck   is after both of them    eileen brennan appears briefly as the cat lady and patricia belcher is jezelle   a psychic who explains the evil creature s bizarre feeding habits    on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10     jeepers creepers   is a fiendishly visceral 2 with an extraordinarily gruesome conclusion   giving new meaning to the old song   jeepers creepers      and now   as paul harvey would say   for the rest of the story    what s more scary than the cruelty of the satanic film itself is the fact that writer director victor salva is a convicted child molester who videotaped himself having oral sex with a 12 year old actor in california    sentenced to three years in prison   he served 15 months and completed parole in 1992    when salva made   powder     1995     the story of an albino boy with supernatural abilities   disney studio executives claimed that they did not know about his prior conviction as a pedophile    and now   once again   in this mgm ua film   that fact is conspicuously absent from his press kit bio

       "487  in 1990   the surprise success an unheralded little movie called ghost instantly rescued the moribund careers of its trio of above the title stars   patrick swayze   demi moore   and whoopi goldberg    eight years later   moore and goldberg s careers aren t exactly thriving   but they have had their share of screen successes since   the same can t be said of swayze   who has just added yet another turkey to his resume with the aptly named black dog    forget the mortal kombat movies  this trucksploitation flick is the closest the movies has come to video games    good truck driver jack crews   swayze   must drive a cargo of illegal firearms from atlanta to new jersey    along the way   jack and his crew of three run into a number of obstacles  such as a highway weigh station   evil truckers   and deadly uzi firing motorcyclists    every so often   like at the end of a video game   level   or   stage     the main baddie pops up   red   meat loaf   fresh from the triumph of spice world     who wants to steal the cache of guns    just in case you forget his name or have trouble keeping track of who s driving what   all of red s vehicles   be it a pickup or a big rig   are painted  you guessed it  red    i could go into more of the plot specifics   such as jack s dream of having a nice home with his family   the past trauma that sent him to prison and cost him his trucking license   the fbi atf crew tracking the cargo     but they are of little importance    all that matters to director kevin hooks and writers william mickelberry and dan vining are the obstacles jack confronts in his drive from point a to point b   but they fail at even this modest goal   for none of the highway chaos   as credibly staged as it is   is terribly interesting   let alone exciting    once you ve seen a couple of trucks bang against each other or a big rig explode the first time   you ve seen it every time    as dreary as black dog is as an entertainment   the saddest part about the film has nothing to do with what shows up onscreen   it s that swayze has to reduce himself to such work    while far from the best of actors   he is certainly not horrible   and he is a charismatic presence    i don t know if it s his judgment or the dearth of quality job offers that leads him to involve himself with bombs such as black dog    regardless   if he continues on this career track   could a tv series be far behind

       "488  tempe mills cinema   az  this movie had us in non stop stitches from beginning to end    all those promotional clips that have been on tv for the past month came from the first five minutes of the movie    if you thought they were funny   see the rest of the movie    it s hilarious    how does one go about making a movie about a couple guys whose only claim to fame is synchronized head bopping on snl to exactly one song    easy    write an interesting script around tried and true ideas   add some good lines and satire   and voil     you end up with an excellent   well done   very entertaining flick    will and chris are idiot brothers forced by their father to work begrudgingly in the family flower business during the day    at night they pursue their life long ambition to loose their virginity in failed attempts to get into the roxbury in beverly hills   ca   the only disco act worth going to    the only problem   the place is so popular and the waiting line so long that by the time the brothers make it to the front door   the roxbury closes   all the while bearing witness to guys with one hundred dollar bills and movie stars like richard grieco who get past the doorman without fuss    the script authors   steve koren   will ferrell and chris kattan   cleverly devised a way for our boys to get into the roxbury    their flower shop van is rear ended by richard grieco   who fears a law suit and is surprised to see the idiots are too star struck to think about the car accident they just had   but not about getting into the roxbury    grieco happily takes them in   even introduces them to the owner   which has the added benefit of enhancing the financial appearance of the idiot brothers in the eyes of a couple of gold diggers   elisa donovan and gigi rice   who bet their time and bodies on will and chris    what follows are some of the best slap stick dancing routines ever    the music is superb   and could have only been made better had the producers added patrick hernandez s born to be alive    the choreography at times was a parody of an era gone by   for example   the bee gees and their stayin  alive    it is nostalgic for those of us who remember that far back   and the technique is a clever adaptation that worked well in forest gump    one of the funniest scenes is when the gold diggers discover that will  and chris don t have any mone y   and dump both on the spot   even expressing violence and anger that they gave sex away    an art imitates life poke at shallow women    it s a scene that s an approximate parody of the vinegar s own rolf luedeke s editorial this week national organization for men   nom   replaces now    ted   unabomber    kaczynski   himself rejected for not having money   will identify well with this scene   if he ever watches the movie    of course   the script wouldn t be complicated enough without adding molly shannon   the girl next door who has had a crush on will since they were kids   and who will has had an aversion to in quest of good looking disco blondes   proof that men will turn down perfectly good women when there are bay watch babes always lurking nearby      nevertheless   will s father wants him to marry molly anyway   but thinks idiot chris is standing in the way and sends him into guest quarter exile    during the wedding ceremony   will s heart isn t exactly into getting married   and when his brother appears on the balcony with a ghetto blaster and more head bopping music   will thinks worse of the knot tieing idea and runs to chris    definitely an snl parody of the graduate where katharine ross changed her mind for the screaming dustin hoffman in the church balcony    i found this scene a riot   however   it went over brandi s head    she was born seven years after the graduate first appeared    the scene has a good punch line when molly shannon marries   instead   the step in buddy weight lifter   who looks like he could pass for the son of gary busy   and who has been lusting for a good looker for a long time   but ready now to take anyone    more art imitates life stuff    not even muscles can substitute for money in the real world    the idiots  mother is played by loni anderson   whose barbie doll looks  don t play well anymore   she s a bit old     and whose cleavage looks like someone botched a tracheotomy too low down    i recommend this movie for anyone who wants to have a lot of fun or in  need of a lot of laughs    go with a date    brandi laughed non stop   as i  did   and a deaf mute might have concluded i was tickling her continuously for 105 minutes

the leading game designer in the world   is testing her new virtual reality game   existenz with a focus group    as they begin   she is attacked by a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun    she flees with a young marketing trainee   ted pikul   jude law     who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard    unfortunately   her pod   an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the existenz game program   is damaged    to inspect it   she talks ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game with her    the events leading up to this   and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesn t exist   as the   players   are forced to perform as characters in an unknown plot    here the reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their own or the game s perspective    i don t intend to reveal more of the film s premise   which is structured as a computer game   with   tasks   that the characters must complete to win the game    released after   the matrix   and   dark city       existenz   has some similarities and parallels that connect it to these films    however     existenz   is moving in a different direction   with a premise of its own    a combination of dazzling special effects   brilliantly coordinated action sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot   made   the matrix   a rare and entertaining science fiction experience   with some dark and frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade       existenz   has a completely different atmosphere   resembling   dark city     which is darker   more serious and less entertaining       existenz   has the opportunities and potential   but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored    after the engaging beginning   it starts to falter    while i was watching the film   many left the theatre during the first hour    and indeed     existenz   seemed as a complete failure   the actors seemed unreal   the plot and dialogue silly   unfinished relationships and unexplained events followed one after another    but the last fifteen minutes lifted the film on a complete different level   explaining all past events   the silly dialogue and the unreal performances within a few scenes    and jet the film fails on several issues    probably the best written character in the story is a game designer   who would rather spend the rest of her life in a virtual world   than face real life    this is a great possibility to create a magnificent character   and jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenberg s script to the limits   but fails because the advantages of virtual reality in comparison to the real world are never shown    existenz is not a world of which you might dream about in your fantasies    it is not a world worth sacrificing your life for    it s a cold   dark place where the   players   are forced to interrelate with unreal characters   eat mutated creatures and even murder against their own will    it doesn t look like a place worth even thinking about    david cronenberg has been the creator of   the fly       videodrome   and   the dead zone     so it s not so hard to guess that   existenz   is a violent and gory film    besides the regular murders of innocent people   the audiences can enjoy an autopsy of a two headed mutated amfibium    scenes like that have become a trademark for cronenberg and it seems that he can t make a film without flowing blood and foul creatures    the way i see it   this is the film s crucial failure    it is impossible for cronenbergto create a beautiful world where time   space and problems of our everyday life do not exist   a place of blooming blossoms   green forests and clear waters   a place really worth sacrificing your life for    because of its lack of three dimensionality   the film looses most of its possibilities   but stays afloat because of some interesting scenes   amusing performances   especially by willem dafoe   and one interesting and important thought   depicted in many different ways throughout the movie    during the film   the audience is as confused as the characters   detached from their everyday existence and no longer able to see the difference between the real world and the alternative reality that they have created       the matrix     despite of its many dark and disturbing thoughts   ends with a light at the end of the tunnel       existenz   does not    it is a one time experience   ending in blood   gore and madness   a rather frightening forecast for tomorrow

       "490  arye cross and courteney cox star as a pair of bostonians who meet in a bar   go to the movies   fall in love   move in together   etc    review         well   if you haven t seen when harry met sally or he said   she said   or if you don t watch love   war on television   you might think this is the most inventive film to come along in ages    however   if you ve seen any of these   than you have seen most of this film    this of course doesn t mean its bad    some of it is amusing   but overall   i just had to ask what s the point    arye cross is the stereotypical single male who falls in love    kevin pollack is the stereotypical female fearing best friend who make a lot of rather sexist and vulgar jokes   most if which weren t very funny    couteney cox is the stereotypical career minded woman who falls in love    julie brown is the stereotypical bizarre best friend of said woman       notice the frequent use of the word stereotypical    this film uses a lot of formula   the plot is basically known from the opening credits      so what is good about the movie    well as i said there are a few amusing moments    surprisingly   julie brown   who i usually find just plain goofy   was the best thing in the film    also there are several very funny sequences involving analysis of the human mating ritual    gee   this is really short    not much to say about the film really    it is just kind of there    watching it on video might not be a complete waste of time   but i wouldn t recommend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot of money to see it at the theatre

a mother     her son marty tells her disgustedly       i know   but i still can t believe it    i look at you people and wonder   how did you ever fit in my womb      marty   you see   is a grown up twin    although his sister   who thinks she is jackie o   is certifiably insane   marty fits right in with the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes    mother and daughter   played in a brilliant performance by parker posey   are both varying degrees of wacko    most dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry and mean spirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is    the daughter s fantasy of being jackie o is probably the most sane part of her being    mrs   pascal is the sort that will not let jackie o keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on that level    she explains to marty s new fiancee   lesly   tori spelling     soon after their first meeting that jackie o was holding marty s private part when she came out of the womb    the dialog by wendy macleod   based on the play by mark waters   is so sharp and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment    the script   reminiscent of a david mamet play   flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence and mesmerizing set of bizarre characters    the exaggerated setup has lesly and marty arriving at the family s out of the way mansion during a thanksgiving day hurricane    in this storm are two sane individuals    the fiancee is a giddy   school girl type   embarrassed by everything   a complete contrast to her rival jackie o s bitter pseudo sophistication    as the two twins  younger brother   anthony   freddie prinze jr   plays the all america boy type whose only foible is his explicit obsession of bedding his brother s fiancee that night       we all have our secrets     jackie o tells her potential sister in law   and boy   does she have a few    this is a house filled with them       when lesly calls it the family s   home   to mrs   pascal    they ve never had a visitor before lesly    mrs   pascal becomes discombobulated until she realizes that lesly is talking about their   house        in a film that gives new meaning to the phrase     made for each other     the twin s biggest   but not their only secret   is that they ve had a long term incestuous relationship    they don t like to discuss it   although they are not particularly ashamed of it    perfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy   this story never pulls its punches    jackie o tries in many ways   few subtle   to show that she is a better match for marty than that ditzy fiancee of his    in one scene marty and lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when jackie o pushes her aside and starts playing a challenging classical piece for four hands    marty joins her as his fiancee looks on with envy    the chemistry between parker posey and josh hamilton is nothing short of amazing    they put down their little brother and most of the other sane people in the world    their ripostes are engaging filmmaking at its best    director mark waters keeps the show s energy level high and lets the leads sling zingers at each other at a furious pace    his crisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce of fat on it    jackie o is temperamentally incapable of being nice    and being jealous   she cuts lesly down mercilessly       were you poor      jackie o asks her when she finds that lesly committed the crime of growing up impoverished       did you eat pies    chicken pot pies         pancakes actually   lots of pancakes     lesly replies with her usual sincerity       a donut king   so is she like the queen        jackie o cattily inquires of marty when she learns that lesly works at a donut king       are we entertaining royalty      with rolfe kent s whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where the story is headed    will it end in a big emotional explosion   a murder   people slowly cutting each other up with words   a familial catharsis   a weather disaster or what    the emotionally charged play is clearly going somewhere   and the engaging characters captivate the audience with their spell    i ll not say more except that the ending is perfect and a bit of a surprise    the house of yes runs a blazing fast 1   25    it is rated r for

       "492           because i m a scientist    that s what we do          dr   alexander mccabe   bob gunton     in response to why he created evil bats    alright folks   stop me if you ve heard this one   genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town and a small band of locals   assisted by a specialist in the particular animal s field   must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth    oh yeah   the military is on their way to bomb the town as well   so they are running short on time    sound familiar    such is the plot of the destination films release of bats    dina meyer stars as the   bat specialist   sheila   who is pulled from her research   along with her annoying sidekick   played with irritating deftness by leon   in order to help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently    with the help of the local sheriff   lou diamond phillips     a cdc official   carlos jacott     and a scientist   bob gunton     sheila discovers it is indeed bats   who have been genetically altered by gunton s character to be more aggressive and omnivorous   in order to be used as a military weapon        i have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film    there s not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good    in this respect   the film never disappointed me    this film reaches a level that transcends the   so bad it s good   level and borders on the downright insane    the effects are awful   the script is contrived   and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously   i think      i challenge anyone to sit through the scene   where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner   with a straight face    thankfully   the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with    dina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in   johnny mnemonic   dragonheart   and starship troopers        the latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit     and this one is no exception    while one never really gets the impression that meyer s character could be a bat expert in reality   one never really cares to doubt it either    she gives as good a performance as could be expected   plus she s nice to look at for an hour and a half    lou diamond phillips is also serviceable here   as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero    although when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what s going on in town   for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats    the only bad performance in the film is that of leon s    he is relegated to the   i m not sticking around here      character and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays    anyone who can t immediately tell that bob gunton   the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films   is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised   but i highly doubt it    even if he hadn t been the villain in just about every film he s ever been in   so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever    in fact   his death is welcome   because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale    if the plot doesn t sound ridiculous to you yet   then check out these little tidbits   a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol    an entire town disregards the sheriff and doctor s orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated   causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force   killing several townsfolk    a government official blows off shelia s instructions   to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats  cave that will kill all of them off   by pulling a night job   resulting in the death of an entire military unit    a cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it    finally   to top it all off   this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it s single screen theater   for reference   our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens   and we re lucky to even get kevin smith s dogma      the most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill conceived bat puppets    while the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing   making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what s going on     the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more low key    therefore we the audience get loving close ups of the most unrealistic   rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film    being able to see the puppeteer s arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse    after all of this   if you still decide bats might be the movie for you   don t say you haven t been warned    trust me when i say that it s a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through    i just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in    she s definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these

       "493  studio 54 attracted so many weird and bizarre people to its gates that it s a wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring   cliched individual   not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldn t be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio   which they did according to this film    are we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly   that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it       54   belongs in the elite group of films known as   the big disappointments     the films that attain so much hype and or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished    i was heavily awaiting   54     not the least because i ve become fascinated with the infamous club   which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that s been running all summer on vh1   which is   weirdly enough   much more intriguing and engrossing than this   edgy   film    perhaps more importantly     54   is part of the blossoming subgenre     the 70s nostalgia film     which has been picking up mighty steam   what with   boogie nights   and   the last days of disco   coming out within the year   and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period   the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period     but brought us interesting and real characters   like scotty   the tragically gay boom mike operator from   boogie nights     and charlotte   the ironically clueless and bitchy co protagonist from   the last days of disco     not to mention several others       54   deals not so much with the timeline of the studio   how it began   how it was run   how it ended     that s all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale   but more interested in the characters who populated it    this is a definite plus    here s a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party   and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases   economy problems   and perhaps worst of all   reagan   all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening    the story of the studio is tragedy in itself   let s look at how it all affected the people    but this film doesn t let that happen    it gives us a half assed protagonist named shane o shea   ryan phillippe   from   i know what you did last summer       who s chief character trait is the fact that he s from new jersey   which also happens to be his chief character flaw   i guess      he s dim witted   into being part of   the scene     and soon finds he s become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars       a  bit like   saturday night fever      cept no travolta and no real interest put into him    poor   poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting   but all he is a half assed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been    shane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club   like anita   salma hayek     a wannabe donna sommers   and her young hubby   greg randanzo   breckin meyer   from   clueless       who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame    although he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster   sela ward     an exec of sorts   he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black   neve campbell     and thus the boring romance subplot that s all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film    the film s sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the all too necesary personage of steve rubell   played by mike myers   you heard me      rubell   the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever   and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation   but the film   thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers   makes him out to be more than that    notice the scenes sole shocking scene   where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion   myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene   and a couple others   that some of us who ve only seen him on tv never saw   and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails    first time feature director mark christopher proves that he s a better director than a writer   though not too terribly much    his story is trite and shallow   as are his characters   and his direction is shockingly flat   especially for a film about this subject    it s as if he had a great story to tell   but instead opted for the easier route    the studio s recreation is amazingly accurate   though   and very impressive   but his direction is never captivating enough    some people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in   despite the film s tone   i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellini s   la dolce vita       and when i watched   54     i

       "494  as fairy tales go   cinderella has to be one of the most famous    almost everyone knows it   well at least in north america    so it is natural that someone will try to make a movie out of it    it has been done before with varying results    this version of the story is both similar to the original and different at the same time    the basic story remains unchanged but   one thing that seems to vanish with this version   and that is all the fantastical elements of the story    there is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature    after the fantastical elements are stripped away what is left is a realistic believable rendition of the cinderella story and an interesting love story at the least        unlike in the fairy tale   the prince plays a much larger part than just that of the masked ball at the end    the   prince    who happens to be the crown prince to the throne of france   meets  cinderella    known as danielle   on a few occasions   most coincidentally and he becomes smitten with her    although this seems to be a far cry from the traditional story it allows for the main plot to proceed with enough room for some imaginative story telling      the story takes place in a renaissance setting   in france   with leonardo da vinci providing some comic relief on more than one occasion    this addition of leonardo da vinci   was quite successful in that it added some color to the movie   since some of the roles are a bit stereotypical    for example the role that was scripted for the prince leaves a few things to be desired    for instance the character seems to be a bit too unstable and fickle   a crown prince should not be anything remotely like that    especially since he is portrayed to be in his mid twenties at the least and almost ready to take the throne    the characters of danielle   cinderella   played by drew barrymore   and that of the evil step mother   played by anjelica huston   are well developed and well played by the two women    although the part of danielle is a bit stretched it is not too unlikely and not totally unbelievable    the nuances of the character are brought out well by drew barrymore and from watching the movie it seems like she had fun making the movie    as a contrast the part of the evil step mother is clearly seen from the very beginning and is almost clique    but   anjelica huston seems to add a certain flair to the role that makes it suit the movie nearly perfectly    the actual story is fairly predictable since it is after all the basic story of cinderella   but there are more than enough twists in how the story is told to make it interesting and enjoyable    the acting is of high caliber and seems deserved of praise    all in all this movie takes you back into history   into a seemingly magical fairy land    but   don t get me wrong there is nothing but reality   it is just refreshing to watch a movie that is not based in a familiar setting with everyday familiar things happening    so although the story is basically familiar the world it is set in is not   and that adds a dimension to the film which in this humble reviewers opinion makes it worth seeing

       "495     the animal   is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along   generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling    it s clunky and slow   like watching an 18 wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill    there are certainly better things you can do with your time    actually   if you ve seen the trailer   then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments    the story centers on bland marvin   rob schneider     who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer    but he s afflicted with loser itis    dogs attack him   neighbors torment him   children bully him   and his co workers ignore him    truthfully   with his bad haircut   seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic   little richard   and giant poodles   and his unenthusiastic demeanor   we d probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun    this is actually bad because you can t like a character if you can t develop sympathy for him    we never do   and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and plummets to the canyon floor    however   marvin is found by an eccentric doctor   michael caton   who uses a radical and experimental procedure to save him   implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs    as a result   marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed    he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body   swim with the speed of a dolphin   and can run as fast as a cheetah    imagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation    with his enhanced abilities   he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him    however   the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn   and instead   marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic   sexual urges    goats beware    he also chases cats   urinates to mark his territory   or growls at his enemies    what he should ve done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich    equally tenuous is its other running joke   which involves one of his friends   guy torry   who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he s black       it s reverse racism     he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything    this element doesn t work the first time it s mentioned   and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence    you don t have to be as wise as an owl to realize that   the animal   is tame    if there s any reason to see this film   it s to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut    remember her    she was voted off in week 11 of the 13 week program     survivor      here   she plays marvin s sunny love interest    while her role required very little actual acting   she seemed very comfortable   even when marvin licks the side of her face like a lapping dog       yuck        with her adorable disposition   radiant smile   and playful innocence   she could be a meg ryan in the making    it s too bad that she s in such a mediocre offering

       "496  jamaica is a hot vacation spot    the exchange rate encourages delusions of wealth   approximately 30 jamaican dollars to one american     the sea is a brilliant blue   the air is warm but lacks humidity    and as tourism is unfortunately jamaica s biggest trade   foreigners enter and leave with a sense of relaxation    life and debt takes a brassy look at life inside this impoverished country    while normal documentaries take the sally struthers approach of underlying scenes of starving children with tearful music   this film guides the viewer with a sarcastic voiceover that brings the troubles home without begging tears to the surface    the voiceover is written by acclaimed author jamaica kincaid    it guides the audience along a tourist s journey and the story of the native inhabitants    instead of telling you what you are already seeing on screen   it quips     you don t see what happens after you flush the toilet      this engages a viewer to see and think about devastation instead of merely being told it is there    this strong   sparse storytelling approach runs throughout the film    stephanie black is also intelligent in how she chooses to disclose the problems faced by the locals    this isn t just another talking head show of people moaning about their horrible lot in life    people are interviewed from all sectors of occupation   from field to factory   as well as social theorists and the banking organizations that continue to invest in the country    the variety of discussion perpetuates a compelling internal dialogue with any viewer   whether they are seeing jamaica for the first time or not    of course   as can be expected   the united states is slammed   owing to its involvement with the international monetary fund and the world bank    officials look moronic as they explain why their plans for jamaica s economy will help the country back on its feet   but only if they are willing to follow the advice word for word    the next moment we see why and how each of these initiatives has failed   usually due to imports being cheaper than local labor or whether or not the soil is appropriate for the next agricultural trend the u   s   is forcing on the citizens    admittedly   some of the back and forth between the business minded organizations and the failures they produce gets repetitive   but it also drives home the impact ignorance can have on both sides of an international argument    but jamaica isn t against the united states   and this documentary does not accuse the u   s   of being the sole perpetrator of its grief    if anything   it begs for a better understanding of the nature of jamaican society before stepping in to change it based on foreign regulations

       "497  some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning   a live action version of mr    magoo being a prime example    the cartoon figure mr   magoo   the bumbling blind man   can be quite funny   but only in small doses and only within the confines of animated images    if you think naked gun star leslie nielsen is a dubious choice to play the role of the short guy who runs into walls   you are right   but there is an even more astonishing selection    for a director they tapped hong kong s stanley tong   whose resume consists mainly of a handful of movies featuring martial arts expert jackie chan    the story   such that there is one   is about a large   stolen ruby   which looks a woolworth reject    mr   magoo gets it and   of course   does not realize he has it    mayhem then ensues as the bad and the good guys chase each other with mr   magoo frequently oblivious to the fact that anyone is being chased    like home alone 3 but without any class   mr    magoo can only be described as painfully bad    fifteen minutes of it feels like an eternity    the movie s humor is pathetically lame   and the pacing is way off    when one is stuck in a theater for an hour and a half watching what claims to be a motion picture   one looks for some solace    mr    magoo provides only three such moments    the movie begins and ends with the classic cartoon version of the character   who exudes his usual charm    the only other saving grave in the movie itself is angus   the sweet little bulldog    angus demonstrates more genuine emotions and a wider acting range than any of the humans in the picture    finally   the ending credits contain outtakes of the movie   which have some of the genuineness and spontaneity that the movie badly lacked    rather than attempt to adapt mr   magoo to a non cartoon movie   nielsen makes the strategic mistake of trying to literally be a human version of the cartoon    he has trouble sustaining the squinting eyes and the affected voice   and even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny    my wife managed to get some sleep during the movie   but i was not so lucky    hopefully   this picture will force producers to think harder about which subjects have promise and which do not    mr   magoo runs 1   37    it is rated pg for comic violence and would be acceptable for all ages    my son jeffrey   age 8   said he thought the movie was good and really funny   but recommends you not choose it if you want an action movie    he said he liked home alone 3 much more    his friend maxim   age 9   said that he thought it was good but very silly and parts did not make sense    his other friend nickolas   age 8   said he d give the movie       1 2   but that it was really silly

       "498  synopsis   nice girl susanne has sex with her boyfriend daniel in his car   visits daniel s rich family during thanksgiving at their mansion in the middle of nowhere   and has sex with daniel again in the basement    susanne and daniel must then decide where to hide from evil art thieves who shoot everyone else in the mansion to steal paintings    brace yourself for one of those painfully obvious   surprise endings      comments   thanksgiving    for most   it s a time to be with your loved ones and enjoy a good   home cooked meal    for the makers of body count   however   thanksgiving is a time for multiple murders   violence   profanity   family dysfunction   and sex    boy   do i feel all the more better having sat through this crap    alyssa milano   the former child star of who s the boss     matures to made for video sludge like this movie    someone somewhere thought it d be a great idea to pair her with rapper ice t   who has since guest starred in the made for the sci fi channel series welcome to paradox    this isn t exactly a winning combination    outside of permanently ruining a holiday for me   what else may be said for this turkey    well   it teaches us that beautiful   attractive women who look strikingly like alyssa milano fall in love with nerds who drive down long winding roads with their eyes closed and complain about being english teachers    it presents us with a heartwarming thanksgiving dinner attended by alcoholic   stuck up rich white people waited on by black servants    it shows us that old guys   try not to laugh   sit around and talk about   the appeal of postmodernism   during their free time    and   it proves that you can have sex in your parents  basement when they have a dozen or so guests over   and no one will notice    before i go any further   if any young male reading this has hopes of seeing alyssa naked   forget it    the filmmakers cleverly shoot the simulated sex scenes in a manner that makes

       "      <td>written by john grisham and robert altman   as al hayes    directed by robert altman  some time ago   a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel    the novel was a summer smash   topping best seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads    the only problem   the novel wasn t very good    it was far more pulp than pulitzer    but the director realized that   no matter how pedestrian the prose   this book really grabbed people   that the author   while not a great writer   was a fantastic storyteller    so he took on the project   convinced he could make something happen on screen    the director    francis ford coppola    the book   of course   was mario puzo s the godfather    the rest   as they say in showbiz   was history    by bringing up the godfather   i don t mean to suggest that robert altman s the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness    but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material    can you get any more questionable than john grisham    depends on whom you ask    but there s no question that grisham s work grabs people    like puzo   grisham is a better storyteller than a writer   unlike fellow hack michael crichton   who is a good idea man but who can t tell a well constructed story from a can of spam    so something in grisham s unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman   who at 73 years old remains one of america s greatest living filmmakers    the result is a gripping thriller that   while falling short of classic cinema   deserves its place in the altman canon     from its opening shot to the closing credits   the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread   with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe    this terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch    witness said opening shot   we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing   undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear    we roll over the hills into the town of savannah   then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone    right away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises    pay attention   boys and girls   this shot was not conceived by john grisham   but by altman    this is what a great director can do for questionable source material    the sports car belongs to rick magruder   kenneth branagh     the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases    magruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office    outside after the party he meets one of the waitresses   mallory doss   embeth davidzt     just as she realizes her car has been stolen    driven by southern chivalry   a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress   magruder offers her a ride home    there he learns more about mallory s life than he bargained for    her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon   robert duvall     a ted kyzynski style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter    magruder   perhaps influenced by mallory s decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him   is sympathetic to her plight   and offers to help her get her father committed   right after he sleeps with her   of course    this simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end    he succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital   and for a moment all appears well    but then dixon s crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup   and suddenly magruder finds himself   mallory and his own children in danger    the cops won t lift a finger to help a liberal attorney    his only allies are his faithful assistant lois   daryl hannah   and his bumbling private eye sidekick clyde   robert downey jr      if this predicament wasn t bad enough   hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos    altman may provide the atmosphere   but branagh s performance holds the gingerbread man together    an accomplished actor when he isn t directing himself in vanity productions   branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives    is his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness   or of egotism    magruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it   and by then it s too late    as the plot unfolds   magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are    and life is never so bad that it can t get worse    if you re familiar with altman s work   you ll recognize several of his signature techniques    characters are not introduced in establishing shots   but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent    crucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows   making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action    dialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style    and of course there s my favorite altman technique   the obligatory nude actress shot    thanks to altman   here are some of the actresses i ve had the pleasure of seeing naked   sally kellerman   julianne moore   madeline stowe   even frances mcdormand    and now i can add embeth davidtz   who looks quite healthy in the altogether    the naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film    is it old school sexism   or a clever in joke    you be the judge    but back to the picture at hand    in the hands of a mere mortal   the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller   no better or worse than the countless others we ve all endured    in the hands of a master like altman   it becomes an exercise in existential doom   in its own way far more successful than scorsese s cape fear remake   which tried for the same result    what may prevent it from enduring with altman s greatest work is a weak third act   in fact   there really is no third act in grisham s story   so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up    but there are true moments of riveting suspense   and great performances by branagh   davidzt and downey jr   more than enough to see you through    that polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman   and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back   should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are    they probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill    and that   my friends   should make you very afraid</td>\n",

eight taels of gold begins as a fish out of water story and at some point becomes a love story involving two people whose past choices prevent the fruition of their love    neither aspect of the movie is entirely successful   but both are good enough    and along the way there is one perfect scene   which is one more than you find in most films    slim   played by portly sammo hung   better known as a star and director of hong kong action movies   is a chinese immigrant who drives a yellow cab in new york    when the movie opens   we see him shouting obscenities at another taxi driver    he does not seem particularly out of place    in fact   he is about to return to visit his home in rural china for the first time in sixteen years   spending most of his life savings in the process   and it is there that he will become the proverbial fish out of water   as he realizes that you can never go home    he brings with him some statue of liberty cigarette lighters   cheap sunglasses   and lobsters   which have to be large   to prove they re american     the tokens of his success    he also wears a gold chain and a gold watch   because without eight taels of gold   a man is not a man   my dictionary tells me that taels are a unit of weight used in the far east   and i assume the phrase is a chinese proverb      he loses most of this stuff  except the gold  when his van crashes into a river and he has to hitch a ride   so to speak   on a raft along the river which runs past his parents  village    when he arrives unannounced   he almost induces cardiac arrest in his father    all of this has the makings of a routine comedy   and the movie has its amusing moments   as when the villagers take turns giving slim gifts during a celebration of his homecoming   and they all give him birds   so by evening s end he is surrounded by turkeys   ducks   geese and other sundry fowl    but eight taels is not a comedy  it is a sad   sweet story about the choices people make   and how they are sometimes irreparable    director mabel cheung   an autumn s tale   the soong sisters   sees clearly what it is like to have lived half of your life in one country and half in a country on the other side of the world  what it is like to no longer have a place to call home    slim does not belong in china   nor does he belong in america   where he can barely speak the language    seeing water buffalo in the fields and rafts poled down the river and fireworks exploding gloriously in the sky over a small village   we come to know the world slim left behind   and it seems as if he too is knowing it for the first time   and wishes it felt more like home    the condition of the expatriate is eloquently portrayed   i   being one   was sympathetic    on his way to his parent s village   slim hooks up with jenny   sylvia chang     whom he knew when she was a girl nicknamed odds and ends   which is what he continues to call her   although she is now a mature   professional   attractive woman   to be married in the spring to an american chinese man    slim and odds and ends fall for each other    that s predictable    the manner in which their   non    romance is played out is not    the emotions involved are adult and complex   and the film avoids cheap solutions to their dilemma    it s typical   for instance   that the fianc   in this sort of plot be a colossal jerk   because it makes it easier to empathize with the unrequited lover    but here the fianc   is a decent   ordinary guy   and although slim would like to feel anger   he cannot    the fianc   has done nothing wrong   the situation is the result of bad luck or bad decisions   take your pick    eight taels has its share of flaws   the early sequences in america and on the plane to china are especially weak     but it compensates with insight    when odds and ends tells slim that her future husband wants to move to san francisco   she notes resignedly     it s all the same    wherever we go   we ll be in chinatown     and her straightforward statement expresses much    there is insight   too   in the understanding of the consequences of slim and odds and ends  decisions   he to move to america   she to marry a chinese american    both their choices were perhaps born of impatience   perhaps of a sense that the grass is always greener  and it turns out that both choices were wrong    but they cannot undo them   they must live with what they have done    such is life    the movie is tender toward these people   but it offers no false comforts    everything that is right and true about eight taels comes together in one great scene   which is the culmination of the love story    slim and odds and ends sit in a secluded spot and talk hesitantly   with the muted pop pop of fireworks exploding in the night behind them   and it seems the conversation will lead to a kiss    the exchange that follows   and what slim then does   is poignant and perfect   with clarity and understatement   we see two people s lives   their heartbreaks and virtues   summed up in a single moment    yes   the film is flawed   but moments like that justify most of its inadequacies</td>\n",

       "      <td>every once in a while   when an exceptional family film comes along   i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been   with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children   it is remarkable how many non disney films disappear in a couple of weeks    now i see that in so doing   i have unfairly ghettoized these films    so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents   but to anyone who wants to support smart   funny   energetic film making   see matilda    see it in a theater   rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video    see the best film i have seen in 1996    not the best children s film       the  best film    period    based on a story by roald dahl   it tells of young matilda wormwood   mara wilson     an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents   harry   danny devito     a crooked used car salesman   and zinnia   rhea perlman     a simple minded bingo addict    the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists   and when they do   it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books    when they finally do send her to school   it is to crunchem hall   a bleak place run by cruel   child hating miss agatha trunchbull   pam ferris      but things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher   miss honey   embeth davidtz     who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness    matilda also discovers another special talent    the ability to move things with her mind    which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull s cruelty    it was this spring s james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them   and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda    and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton   matilda soars on the cock eyed direction of danny devito    devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses   and he contributes some memorable images    in one scene   an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig tails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer   later   an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert    matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale    it is also characteristic of the best children s tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don t realize that they are learning them    there is a hilarious moment when matilda s television addicted father snatches away the book she is reading   in a wicked joke   he thinks  moby dick  is pornographic   and forces her to watch an inane game show   hosted by jon lovitz   in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around    matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment   and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child    that because   i m big and you re little   i m right and you re wrong      more specifically   it has as its heroine an intelligent   self confident girl who struggles successfully against other people s notions of how she should behave    it is no coincidence that matilda was co written by robin swicord   who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women    finally   matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment   it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word    devito knows enough to make matilda fast paced and appealing to children   taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy   including a great chase through her dark house    the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable   with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character    but there are also many   many delights for adults   including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda s classmates recite in sing song fashion   there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda s father    i can t imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted    matilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling    i will see it again   and years from now i will watch it with my children    and now i will stop   because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin   and there is a seat in that theater you should be in   if you have a child or ever were a child</td>\n",

       "      <td>depending on your degree of cinematic acumen   last man standing is either a   a prohibition era remake of akira kurosawa s 1961 classic yojimbo   b   a prohibition era remake of sergio leone s 1964 classic a fistful of dollars   c   a prohibition era action drama with a completely original story line    new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category   c   than in the other two combined   much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons    the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing   which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the  real  source material   the dashiell hammett novel  red harvest     it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself    this time around   the man with no name is played by bruce willis   a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico    by all appearances   jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town   with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border    one is headed by an irishman named doyle   david patrick kelly     the other is run by chicago connected italian mobster strozzi   ned eisenberg      calling himself john smith   the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict   and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle s side    but smith s allegiance is as uncertain as his name   and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them    viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint   and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes cum bastardizations    there is the happily ineffectual lawman   bruce dern     the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses  affections   karina lombard     the barkeep who becomes our anti hero s only friend   william sanderson     suspicious lieutenants   christopher walken and michael imperioli   to question the bosses  trust in smith   a brutal beating   and a big fire    director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids   including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity   but at least he doesn t try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture    what he  does  do is nearly as big a mistake   and that is to provide a running voice over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard boiled style of pulp detective fiction    yes   that narration is full of cliches   but those are are not particularly troubling    the problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters    they were a mystery   to the other characters in the film and to the audience   their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted   and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status    with john smith s voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought   he becomes more mundane   just another tough guy trying to stay alive    it feels like a hammett novel   all right   and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice   but it simply doesn t work    the narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence   and the man with no name takes  no one  into his confidence    even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate   i can t imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction    willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith   but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else    christopher walken plays doyle s brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft spoken psychos   and there isn t another single character whom makes even the slightest impression    with no compelling antagonist for smith   there is no build up towards the expected showdown   and when it does come   that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about    cinematographer lloyd ahern   who also did the only noteworthy work on hill s 1995 flop wild bill   creates some nifty sunburned vistas   but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter productive narration    sometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original   they ll wonder what all the talk was about    in the case of last man standing   it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about</td>\n",

       "      <td>the faculty     the heavily hyped and advertised sci fi horror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez   1995 s   desperado   and 1996 s   from dusk till dawn     and screenwriter kevin williamson   1996 s   scream   and 1997 s   scream 2       is being called a cross between   invasion of the body snatchers   and   the breakfast club     and i don t think i could describe it any better than that    the film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common   and then the science fiction aspect is added   involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town    the six characters   as in   the breakfast club     can be easily labeled as a stereotype   but as they are developed   they become far more complex   casey   elijah wood     the much picked upon nerd   stokely   clea duvall     a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her   zeke   josh hartnett     a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz   stan   shawn hatosy     the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics   delilah   jordanna brewster     the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist   and marybeth   laura harris     the sweet  n southern new girl in town    although the characters are only slightly connected   i   e    casey is delilah s photojournalist assistant   marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely   since they both don t have friends   etc       when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences   the only people they can count on for help is each other   even though they aren t really even sure if they can trust one another       the faculty   is another smart and pop culturally hip film from williamson   although it does not equal up to his best film   the original   scream     and rodriguez   whose   from dusk till dawn   is still one of the more original genre films of the 90 s    williamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions   respectively   that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no brainer    the plotline of   the faculty     involving aliens taking over other people s bodies   has been done quite a lot before   from   invasion of the body snatchers     to   the puppet masters     to   invaders from mars     so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh   and by setting the goings on at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens   they were mostly successful    surely   the conventions of the story are still the same   and the climax was inevitable   but there were a few surprises along the way   including the question of who were the aliens   and who weren t    the epilogue was also a refreshing change of pace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a note that probably could not have been any better    the performances in   the faculty   were a treat throughout   since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do    one exception were the teens   who   aside from elijah wood   are not very well known   but they all aquit themselves nicely   particularly wood   the seasoned pro     clea duvall   and jordanna brewster    as members of the faculty   robert patrick     t2   judgement day     was creepy as the gym coach   piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher   bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien   and salma hayek   as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold   was very funny in a small role    the standout   in my opinion   of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who   after turning into an alien   becomes the sex bombshell    if there was any problem i had with the faculty   it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence    since the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the   queen   alien   many of the faculty members disappear    it might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers   although the finale is still pretty impressive   and includes some showstopping creature effects   especially for a relatively low 15 million dollar budget    although not one of the best horror or science fiction films i have seen     the faculty   is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released    while the story is as old as the hills   it is also   in a way   timeless   because everyone   i think   has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right   as if they really weren t human    and by putting this idea in the setting of a small town high school   it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers      note   the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading   as it features r   b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters    in actuality   he only has a small role as one of stan s buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team    if i were one of the heads from dimension   i would change this advertising at once   since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving</td>\n",

       "      <td>according to popular film opinion   a film s greatness is determined by time    take for example   casablanca      great film   even today    it s still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic    another example would be   star wars     which had a very   very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about 3 billion times before    but as i rewatched   independence day   when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996   i kinda felt like it wasn t as cool as when i had first seen it    i had liked it when i saw it the first time         was my original view   and basically saw it as a good   escape film      but when i rewatched it   i felt cheated    thus   the curse of the   event film         independence day   is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once   except for a couple kids   the critics   in this situation      but after a while   this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one    well   this kid is the   event film   in my little analogy    and when i rewatched   independence day     not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen   but i felt insulted the whole time    there are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just aren t sure if it s comedy or hokey drama    one scene   you ll see a hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch   the next you ll see a bunch of military uptight guys walking around   saying corny lines    the worst is a scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of   glen or glenda      now this annoying kid s problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once   he shows he has no balls    and   independence day   has no balls    it plays it safe everywhere    it throws in a ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films    the chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of   star wars      i mean   isn t that devil s den    and the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moore s breasts in   striptease      they re these octopus men   boring freaking octopus men    i mean   come on    the aliens in   2001   were more interesting and you didn t even see them    basically the plot is straight from a b movie from the 50s   aliens come to earth and we wonder if they re hostile or peaceful    okay   it s an interesting topic   but it s not handled greatly    now they aren t and somehow a computer geek   jeff goldblum   figure out they re using our satellites as a countdown to destruction    yep    these aliens are not only heavily armed   they re stupid too    they also use the same kind of computer as we do   but that comes about later    the president   bill pullman     who s under attack for being a wimp   decides this would be a nice time to be belligerent   and he decides he ll stay in the white house which the aliens have covered    i don t care if it s bob freaking dole in the white house   get him out of there    i don t care if you have to inject him with sodium pentathol   just get him out of there    later on   he s stupid and wants to fly in the attack on a big alien ship    i think it s time for impeachment for this guy    he s more senile than reagan on pot    then there s a cocky pilot   will smith   who is the only person to survive the counter attack on the second day and becomes moses in leading his children to the elusive area 51   the film s only sign of being brave      his girlfriend s a stripper sharing a subplot with   striptease   in that she has to do it for her son    come on   she has a fighter pilot boyfriend soon to be fiance    i think she can quit that job and get a more respectable job at long john silvers    she s also the few   the proud   the lucky to survive the igniting of l   a     as well as her dog   who narrowly survives      there are some bright spots    they tossed in enough old film homages to keep me laughing    the best one is when jeff goldblum   nicely named david   turns on his computer and a picture of hal comes up and says     good morning   dave      and they even played r   e   m    s     it s the end of the world as we know it   and i feel fine   at the beginning    and judd hirsch steals the film by actually acting great   he s a stereotype   but i just loved the man anyway      but there are no real subtle comic moments    will gets way too many one liners and he has no one to play off of   execept jeff towards the end   and the two do great      as i said   this film has no balls    it is just aiming for a crowd pleaser and that s what it is    but after a couple months   we all move on to the next   event   film while intaking little films and a couple indy ones for good measure    but at least the indy ones last for a lifetime    this one s short on batteries</td>\n",

       "      <td>paul verhoeven   the dutch auteur who dragged his violent   sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film   has never been what i d consider a thoughtful director   though some of his films   notably starship troopers   have been lauded as artistic achievements     but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who s managed to   no matter what the budget   make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils    starship troopers was essentially a b monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange   a great film that s nearly impossible to find on video   yet showgirls is everywhere     in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins   the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards   who may actually be 45  silicone     in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage    it s not a completely successful film   but as a failure it s certainly an interesting   and mostly entertaining   one    my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores   spetters   a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange   haven t yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight      i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop   a bleak super hero satire with a robotic hero that s as touching as schwarzenegger s in t2    that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics    its violence seemed to be there for a purpose   namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread   not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience    there s a jaw dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him    he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim s every fearful tic    it s a startling moment of barbaric   maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk noir    in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won t shut up   he impales a co worker   drowns another and so on    but why    his character is introduced as a smug genius   the kind who s always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear   sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place   though once the character becomes invisible   this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster    the kind who just won t die    hollow man s protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda   elizabeth shue   acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm   and her lover   a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who s saddled with the film s worst lines     i ve lost cohesion again          they re a typical aaron spelling couple   good looking but as vacant as george w   bush s republican national convention speech   i   e    bush referring to clinton           so much promise       but to what end    to what end         this actually got applause    suddenly warren beatty doesn t look so absurd      the rest of the film s characters are all well past thirty   though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained one liners   is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood s new character developing technique    ahh   what a cynical time we live in        as the picture opens we meet cain   kevin bacon     an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret   so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation s   project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility   for what purpose is never hinted at      they ve performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine   in a twist worthy of the film s 1950 s late show origins   to impulsively experiment on himself    caine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his co workers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead    our mad scientist is turned invisible   after several fx heavy complications     then he inexplicably   it s hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures   but this is never explored   and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human      begins raping   assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases   always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger    it grows abundantly clear with each new release that it s verhoeven s films that have become hollow    like the rest   this one is cold   heartless   and full of contempt for humanity   but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit   insight and makes no statement other than   audiences will pay for anything these days      it s an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level   or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun   thrill a minute ride    verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care    the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick    how can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self    a couple weeks ago   after seeing the trailer   a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability    hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa   in a serious manner to boot    but oh yeah   it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway    verhoeven delivers the sleazy   goods     but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner   here it just feels icky and uncomfortable    the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses   caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux psycho music strains in the background    it s plainly obvious that verhoeven isn t exploring voyeurism   like in the classic peeping tom   but exploiting it and not even doing that very well    it s funny that with all the technology  90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a woman s naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand    most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks    in fact it s largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since   by the end   most of his potential victims don infer red glasses that track his body heat    as in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov   a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre     and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked    the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy    it happens when a lab assistant   kim dickens   who looks like she stepped out of playboy   in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon   suddenly pauses       are you looking at me       she queries   obviously haunted    it s a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a plot that should have run its course by 1982   the apex of the mad slasher craze      those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you did last summer    and they re the only reason to check out hollow man   preferably as a mid week bargain rental    you ve been warned    but you probably won t listen   will you    tis  a pity</td>\n",

       "      <td>this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bont s debut as a director   1994 surprise hit speed    but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead    annie   sandra bullock   is in the wrong place at the wrong time again    she s going on a cruise with her new boy friend alex   jason patric     and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger   willem dafoe   who has a bone to pick with the shipping line    they sacked him after he got sick    now he wants the diamonds stored in the ship s safe for compensation    that actually is the whole storyline    speed 2 could do without dialogues    the movie is all about images and remarkable sound    i don t really know why this is called an action movie    except for a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies    first we are introduced to a number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie    then desaster strikes    sandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around    i looked for the   action   but couldn t find it    most of the time she is part of the decoration    the only time she is part of what happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind a fire door    now we know that she can handle a chain saw    we also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds    the bomb defusal of course goes wrong   but only the furniture is damaged   not our heroes who still are needed    jason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting with annie   helping other passengers and frolicking in the water    his initial sea sickness is suddenly gone   because there are ship   crew and passengers to be saved from evil geiger    he does a pretty good job but i can t blame keanu reeves for declining this part    then there s willem dafoe   the villain   who desperately tries to look as frightening as frankenstein s monster    he doesn t succeed   though    an untidy appearance isn t enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential    before he tries again to make us believe he is a dangerous man he should practise for a while in front of a mirror    i can t really recommend speed 2   you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that aren t meant to be funny    especially the showdown   when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then dissembles a whole village is a treat    there you get to see the most superfluous scene in the movie    in keeping with last year s desaster movie tradition a dog is miraculously saved from certain death    a really funny   and meant to be funny   scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision    some crew members watch two ships colliding in an old movie    had they looked out the window they wouldn t have missed the huge ship racing toward them    those of you who still want to see the movie should pick a theater with a large screen and a good sound system to enjoy the visual effects and the phantastic surround sound effects    in an adequately equipped theater it s as if the explosion were going off all around you and you can feel the seats vibrate    but the ilm special effects can t save the movie    for all the money they could have done better</td>\n",

       "      <td>the reunion film is not an original idea in any way   shape   or form    it s been done throughout film history over and over again   and has become one of the many sub genres   like the prep school sub genre   the angst filled teen sub genre   and the slasher sub genre    what makes   peter s friends   so remarkable is not how it doesn t follow the rules of this sub genre   but how it follows it so well   and creates characters that i wouldn t mind hanging with    what are the rules of the reunion sub genre    well          1   you need a group of friends   most of them married or at least dating   and sometimes even married or dating eachother    2   you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis    3   they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart    4   the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10    5   they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic    6   the reunion has to bring them together   seperate them with little crises   then bring them back together because   after all   they re friends    7   there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited    8   eightly   they re all unhappy or marginally so    9   there s some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that s built up over the years    10   the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts   sometimes internationally so    11   the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends   sometimes causing them to get together in dance song    since it follows these rules so closely   it will probably be   and has been   coined off as just a   british  big chill        and in some ways it is    both follow the rules   as i said   and both feature lots of bitching   big confessionals   and broken relationships    but while   the big chill   was   at least to me   a tad too whiny and unsatisfying     peter s friends   hits its mark   making this film funny   dramatic   and poignant    the friends of peter s were all in the same theatre group back in  82   performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them   the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus      after peter s   stephen fry   wealthy father   richard briers   hardly on screen enough to register   but oh well   dies   leaving a giant mansion to him   he has to decide whether or not to keep it    not sure what to do with it immeadiately   he decides to throw a giant reunion party   inviting back all his old chums    of course   all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule    andrew   kenneth branagh   also directing here   is an actor who s unhappily married to a tv star   carol   co writer rita rudner      maggie   emma thompson   is a successfuly publisher of self help books   but looks like she needs them more than her customers   as she is lonely and unhappy    roger and mary   hugh laurie and imelda staunton   who were also married in   sense and sensibility     are married   and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk   but have suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died    and sarah   alphonsia emmanuel   is as promiscuous as ever   having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian   tony slattery   who s married and wants a divorce because of her   giving her doubts    as for peter   things seem okay        the film features lots of inner friend jokes   and even some old theatre anecdotes   which i at least find a lot of fun in   as i ve done lots of theatre myself      and there are big confessions   brawls between the friends   and by the end   almost everyone is unhappy   even though some have resolved their problems long before the end   which i kinda dug      the final twist would seem forced an anti climactic   but for some reason   i felt the same way the rest of the friends did    maybe it s because the people in this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique    that s really what makes   peter s friends   so lovable   the way you just want to hang with a group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes   but when someone s in crisis   can come together wonderfully for one another    it s when you have a giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends   and these people are true friends    not to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the 80s   a decade i grew up in   unfortunately   without taking us outside of the 90s    there are some 80s classics and anti classics like tears for fears   everybody wants to rule the world     but unfortunately no stupid fun 80s songs   i think if i ever did an 80s reunion film   i d put some crap go gos song on   or at least some good old   come on eileen       but this is the british 80s we re talking about    oh well    but anyway   the direction is pretty good   although nothing amazing    branagh s forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical   but at least he s very good with making a less ambiguous film like this    the writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman   with lots of good one liners   and even some really bad but good puns   to mock the fact that andrew lives in l   a     peter   while cutting some logs   asks him is he has wood in l   a     and andrew says     no   but we have hollywood     punishment like that      the actors   as in most speaking movies   are better than their material   though   with some stand out performances to the six friends   as well as the outsiders like slattery   rudner   and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peter s mansion    a little note should be made about hugh laurie s performance   as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this   i mean   i ve never seen him actually act this dramatically       peter s friends   is a really enjoyable film which makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion   although i don t know what kind i ll have   like most people   i don t look forward to my high school reunion      because of the way these friends are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such a long period of seperation   i just look forward to the day when i can have friends like that</td>\n",

       "      <td>many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come   the new film by visionary director vincent ward    most will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors    but little do they know   as i so plainly found out   that this has quite a complex story to tell    walking out of the theater   i could see the audience s disgust        one member even had to be awakened after the film ended    don t believe the previews that you see        this is definitely not a film for everyone    this is quite possibly one of the most adult oriented films to come out in recent years    kids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline    the plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us    it goes back and forth in time   as if it has no boundaries    think of the film city of angels    now add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision    both films deal with the afterlife   but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office    costing around  85 million to make   the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it s money back    but due to it s story   i doubt it will    for everyone who thought titanic s story was too simple and cliche   here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay   it may not have done nearly as well    but don t get me wrong        i hope the film does do well    it s a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen    i doubt most of us could have thought of this place   even in our own mind    what dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals    the only film that surpasses it is dark city    full of rich   shocking colors   we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to    but don t do that   because you ll end up going to hell    what dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake    chris   christy   nielsen   robin williams   is startled by the sudden jolt   but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat    annie   annabella sciorra   spies chris   as well   and both eventually bond and get married    annie is an artist   whose paintings are colorful   lush   and surrealistic    chris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself    they also have two children   marie   jessica brooks   and ian   josh paddock      but one day   the two children are killed in a car crash   and it almost destroys annie    she tries to commit suicide   but fails   and is then put in an institution    chris copes with the problem by realizing they aren t around anymore   and nothing will change that    just as annie gets her life back in order   chris is killed while trying to save the life of a car crash victim    chris goes to heaven   or his version of heaven   rather    guided by albert   cuba gooding   jr       chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight and joy    that is   until he realizes how miserable he is without annie    prior to heaven   he would try to comfort annie   but the more he was around   the more pain she felt    chris decides to leave her alone    little does he realize what will happen next    i m not about to say   because the plot point is crucial to the rest of the story   many critics   however   give it away      certainly   chris dying is crucial to the plot   but they tell you that he dies in the previews    story is not necessarily important for this movie to work   because it deals with the afterlife    however   strangely   virtually nothing is heard of god or the devil    a couple of comments here and there   but the story maintains its focus on chris and his search for the love of his life       we re soul mates      chris exclaims    heaven   in movies   is almost always depicted as a glowing city of white   purity   and love    usually   it also looks like it rests among the clouds    but what dreams may come goes a different route    it shows us a heaven that most of us have never seen before    chris  heaven is his memories brought to life    his thoughts can make anything real   and he makes the paintings annie drew become his heaven       i ve never seen anyone use real paint before     albert says    equally good as the depictions of hell which cast away the normal stereotypes of fire and brimstone    instead   it s a state of being    in one gloriously horrific scene   chris and his   tracker     max von sydow   arrive at a sea of faces    thousands of heads are stuck above ground   their bodies somewhere else    mostly dead silent   some quips are made   almost as if to lighten the mood    it s truly a frightening sequence    production designer eugenio zanetti is definitely going to be up for an oscar nomination    using state of the art computer technology   worlds are created for exploration    sometimes   some scenes play out as if they are only there for the visual impact    it s not necessary to be there   but we appreciate seeing it    costume designer yvonne blake   who also appears in the film   has done an incredible job providing some interesting and colorful costumes    cinematographer eduardo serra   whose work was last seen in the luscious wings of the dove   has a difficult job   as most cinematographers do working with special effects    but serra s entire universe is a computer generated image   and he does a masterful job    writer ron bass   adapting from the novel by richard matheson   provides a very fluid screenplay with no real set plot    the story is extremely vague in its details   allowing viewers to think for themselves about the meaning    and director vincent ward puts it all together into his final vision    what dreams may come is a good example of german expressionism which may just turn off a good portion of the audience    your average movie goer more than likely isn t used to expressionistic techniques    the film will also definitely draw attention from religious people   but they shouldn t take it too far    it is   after all   just a movie    robin williams has continuously impressed with his dramatic performances   while his comedic roles have been suffering    his comedy is perfection when he makes up his own stuff   but when is confined by a screenplay   he isn t quite as effective    but drama is really his strong point   and you can see that here    it s doubtful he ll get another oscar nomination   but i wouldn t really mind if he did    the real surprise here is annabella sciorra who impressed last year with cop land    this may be her breakout role and may garner her some much needed attention    it s also quite possible that she could get an oscar nomination    however   the academy doesn t like to award performances for these types of films    cuba gooding   jr   has been better   but he s certainly not distracting    max von sydow is underused   as are jessica brooks and josh paddock    a treat for some movie goers is to see werner herzog appear   if they even recognize him   as chris  father lost in the sea of faces    it s not hard to see why herzog would be attracted to this film   considering he thinks that audiences are starving for great images    overall   it s williams and sciorra s film    what dreams may come is rated pg 13 for thematic elements involving death   some disturbing images   language   and some partial nudity    the film is definitely aimed at a more adult audience    some will find the plot distracting    some will find the visuals absolutely glorious    and some will find both    the only real problem with the film   that i could see   was that it slows down considerably during the midsection   just after we have been immersed in the visuals and before the search for annie begins    by the way   some controversy even surrounded the title   which was mistaken for a sexual term     what   becomes   wet   and you should understand      in actuality   the title is from a soliloquy in hamlet    just thought i should let you know</td>\n",

       "      <td>note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    like its own opening shot   from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity   persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent    a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry   boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking    the film follows a soft spoken young man   eddie adams   mark wahlberg   from torrance   through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom   and later   to a harrowingly precipitous drop    as boogie nights opens   he s toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub   and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity    recruited by fatherly jack horner   a rejuvenated burt reynolds     a successful porn filmmaker   eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler   pornstar    wholeheartedly embraced by jack s troupe   including the maternal amber waves   julianne moore     reed rothchild   john c   reilly     buck swope   don cheadle     rollergirl   heather graham     dirk and his   one special thing   are quickly propelled to the top of his field   fulfilling his mantra of being a   big bright shining star      his lack of discipline   however   incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in    the element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr   anderson   whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious    from the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool   mr   anderson s accomplished command of the camera is without question    while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating   impertinent and self congratulatory   case in point   marc rocco s unforgettable perpetual motion helming of murder in the first     in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr   anderson   be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp   is purposeful and potent    it s a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker s career    boogie nights is only his second feature film   following up his debut feature from earlier this year   hard eight    and although it s somewhat derivative   his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman   while in terms of visuals he s clearly influenced by martin scorsese     at least he s borrowing from some of the best   and it s entirely effective within the context of this film    while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective   in terms of sheer entertainment value it s also rollicking good fun   with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour    the film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music   clothes   hairstyles   dance   idioms   and culture   aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges   and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent   pre aids scare period in american history where uninhibited   free wheeling lifestyles abounded    while much of the film s humour pertains to the characters  obliviousness of now outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society    a prime example is part time salesman buck swope s demo of a stereo system with an eight track tape   and inviting a prospective customer to get  freaky deaky  with the music    it s elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule   but of wistful reminiscence   and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous    a giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny   to be sure   but oddly magical   and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie dirk s bedroom   completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures   farrah fawcett   cheryl tiegs   bruce lee   is breathtaking    ably supported by a well selected collection of period music   all of which purportedly came straight from mr   anderson s personal collection     there s a clear affection for the era in boogie nights    it s the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline   the film s promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters    after the debacle with 1996 s milos forman film   the people vs    larry flynt   another finely crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography related storyline   the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public    however   while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago   it s hardly a lurid or seamy film    given the subject matter   there s very little nudity   and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous    and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality   but simply as a business    the glimpses on the sets of jack horner s shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate   there s a candid matter of factness in terms of sex   his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job   and it s refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking   such as coercion or debauchery   are avoided    if anything   boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves    jack horner s dream is an honourable one    he genuinely aspires to make a great film    and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood   albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence      in both films   the world of quickie low budget filmmaking is explored   and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton   scott alexander   and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets    jack s retort of   there are shadows in light   baby   to his cinematographer s complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood s   it s not about the little details   it s about the big picture      rant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false    in boogie nights and ed wood   the aspirations of the respective filmmakers  prove to be bemusing   not in their intentions    there s nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an  artistic  erotic picture    but in the degree that they miss the mark    much like the humour lacing ed wood   the laughs involving jack horner are double edged   after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres   when jack breathes   this is the best work i ve ever done     it s genuinely funny   but given his utter sincerity   also possesses a tinge of sadness    mr   anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter    while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging   there really isn t any clever dialogue in the film   though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film s characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges   when one considers that the film s   protagonist   literally doesn t say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time   it s no wonder why the playfully inane   how much can you bench      banter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film s finest exchanges    and while mr   anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters   it s problematic that some of the the threads given to the film s characters are simply stale material    julianne moore s child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff   better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv movie version of her character s story   and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions    still   even if he doesn t always know what to do with his characters   mr   anderson most definitely captures their essences   and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious    misguided   even aimless   hopelessly naive   self destructive   insufferable   i loved them just the same    in any case   it s hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired   and ultimately best executed   scenes of the year   a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson   a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance   even if it s a small one   in a suicidal drug deal scam   only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric   the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger s   sister christian   on his stereo system is sheer brilliance   flanked by an armed bodyguard    if this scene already wasn t tense enough with these elements   mr   anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene   who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room   pushing the scene to a new   surreal level of delightful giddiness    there are some other interesting touches in boogie nights    mr   anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight   here   it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect    similarly   a painful scene where crew member scotty j   philip seymour hoffman   breaks down in tears in the driver s seat   sobbing   i m so stupid   after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver s seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening    boogie nights is exceedingly well cast   and each of the actors rise to the occasion   the ensemble cast is uniformly good    while most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr   wahlberg   fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films   and mr   reynolds   terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film   ringing true in every respect     a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention    mr   reilly demonstrates here   as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbard s georgia   a genuine aptitude for comedy    many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film    i m not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot   but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee    mr   reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number   and it s wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation    worth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad   and dead on period   it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me   demo track   you got the touch   in a vain attempt at a musical career    mr   reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective    ms   graham   with her long dirty blonde hair   innocent demeanour   and huge hazel eyes   looks like a disney animated heroine come to life    or in this case   a disney animated heroine who came to life   made a wrong turn   and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late 70s   early 80s adult film industry    consequently   it s a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweet faced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates   but in a scene where she s lounging in a limousine prowling the streets   garish red lipstick messily smeared on   giving the camera a hilariously pouty come hither look   all one can do is gulp    her role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out   err    in a figurative sense      she s essentially a glorified extra    but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity       if only mr   anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face   though      and a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish   as a teen   ms   graham s parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers   since then   her most notable roles have been as a junkie   gus van sant s drugstore cowboy   and now a porn starlet    draw your own conclusions    perhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr   cheadle   who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity   and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion    his relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st   vincent   an interesting melora walters   is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness   and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible   it s no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry    while the scenario is familiar   the wounded look in cheadle s eyes makes the scene unforgettable    luis guzman s most famous work is possibly in brian de palma s carlito s way   and here he plays a variation on the same character   maurice t   rodriguez is a hapless but good natured nightclub owner who s a hanger on to jack s group   ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack   with little disguise made of his desperation   for a part in one of his erotic pictures    jack s eventual acquiescence to maurice s request leads to one of boogie nights  biggest comic payoffs    boogie nights is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr   anderson   who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of note with this work    striking a fine balance between humour and drama   and exceptionally well crafted   there s no doubt that boogie nights is among the very best films of the year</td>\n",

wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation   pure drivel   1998      much of the book spares tinseltown from mockery   although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview   in a fine chapter called   in search of the wily filipino      now   as writer and star of bowfinger   he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a career in the cinema   perhaps finally venting the frustrations    everything being made now is crap    that led to his brief retirement from hollywood    martin stars as bobby bowfinger   a roger corman wannabe on the cusp of fifty and desperate for some success as a producer   quality of the projects be damned    his accountant   adam alexi malle   proposes a movie called   chubby rain     about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops    bowfinger latches onto the idea immediately   and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film   based on the lie that america s top box office draw   kit ramsey   murphy     has agreed to star    ramsey   of course   wants nothing to do with such low grade material   so bowfinger   on the thinking that action stars need to run   not speak   decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously    he sends his cast members   who aren t in on it   either   they are told ramsey hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his co stars   to ramsey s table at restaurants   asks them to follow him in parking lots   etc     spouting script dialogue   all the while shooting the outcome from a great distance    the paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time    ramsey is a member of mind head   a cultish self help organization apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities       as if that s not familiar enough   mind head guru terry stricter   terence stamp   has been dressed and combed to resemble l   ron hubbard   founder of scientology      when he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble   white code   in his face   they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him off to a retreat   requiring bowfinger to find a stand in    murphy will probably win more fans as jiff   ramsey s adorable   ignoramus double   than as kit   but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage    always surrounded by an entourage   suffering from a racial inferiority complex   murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself    furthermore   consider the enemies he ll make of popular scientologists    pacing stricter s neutral coloured office as if on an amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer   ramsey is asked to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly    murphy s scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine of a john travolta   clearing      not that murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick   bowfinger is steve martin s invention    his script is surprisingly clever as satire   given that the pseudo religion is a sitting duck   as is the entire los angeles film industry       the griffin mill types take quite a beating   in the form of robert downey jr   as bigwig jerry renfro      martin s decision to tell the story from a bottom feeder s point of view is what keeps it fresh and innovative never have we seen on screen a group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture    as expected   there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs   such as martin s crew of mexican border jumpers   who gain unexpected appreciation for the classics from reading   cahiers du cinema     or martin s nonsensical explanation to dave   his loyal cinematographer   jamie kennedy     that every movie   in the end   has a budget of two thousand dollars          most of bowfinger is universally funny   however   i defy any viewer to keep a straight face when christine baranski   one of our brightest comediennes   is on screen    bowfinger s main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial aftermath    we re also asked to believe that a few simple close ups of kit ramsey would redeem   chubby rain     z grade entertainment that would make ed wood blush       this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in oz s last directorial effort   the poorly conceived in   out      these are significant enough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece    as i mentioned at the start of this review   bowfinger offers solid reasons not to do what heather graham s character daisy does   hop a bus to hollywood in search of stardom    that said   it offers one fantastic reason to get on that bus   the sense of community between filmmakers who gel is awesome    martin gets sentimental by story s end

the movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworth s latest commercials condemning affirmative action    the montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy    when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv   having gone without food or sleep for days    his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care    first he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe   a  10 million life insurance policy in his daughter s name    then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination    his assistant murphy   oliver platt   is oblivious to bulworth s suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements    bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african american church   then takes questions from the audience    he is hit hard with questions about his voting record    he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots   and it hasn t shown up    since he s a dead man anyway   he figures he ll answer truthfully   he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l   a   for the photo opportunity    they made some promises that improved their public image for a while   and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made    the shock and outrage from the congregation grows   the questions keep coming   and he keeps shooting back honest   if ugly   answers       before i go further   i d like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make   and that is that characterizing african americans as malt liquor drinking o   j    fans is not part of bulworth s   truth      that line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie    when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics   this line is not what they re talking about      the experience is liberating    with nothing left to lose   bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth    he can say whatever he wants because he s going to be dead anyway    why not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician   that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists   and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism    bulworth s candor wins him three volunteers from the church   one of whom   nikki   halle barry     he gets a crush on    he feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something    chicken wings   appropriately enough    bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives    when one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings   bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment    with so much money and so many talented people working so hard   he wonders   why can t hollywood make a quality product       you go   warren      when they become indignant and ask why he s talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product   he callously admits that it s because they are rich jews    that night he drops the three african american volunteers at their nightclub   and he decides to go in with them    he stays up all night drinking   smoking pot   dancing   falling in love with nikki   and learning to scratch turntables and rap    the next day   he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suit and tie fundraisers    from then on   at all of his political appearances   he raps his political truth    his rap is not bad for a middle aged white guy    he s not very good   but it is his first try and at least he s not embarrassingly bad    his lobbyists are not amused   but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth    eventually   the movie s plot   remember he hired a hit man      overtakes the politics   which is too bad    screen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him    there are even a few gratuitous chase scenes   bulworth fleeing his killer    these scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along   but it distracted and detracted from bulworth s political ranting   which was much more interesting than the ever present   obvious looking assassin    still   most of the movie is original and very enjoyable   and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen    as the story and screen writer   he came up first with a good structure   then with good dialogue to back it up   jeremy pikser co wrote the screenplay      as an actor   he was able to convincingly portray bulworth s depression   then liberation and rebirth    as a producer   there were four others   he was able to keep the movie free from hollywood s indulgent formulas   except for those inexcusable chase scenes      someone else probably could have directed   but since he was there anyway   what the heck    it s too bad that there aren t more movies like this around   movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics    after all   much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news    just a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants    just don t expect to be popular with the insurance companies</td>\n",

       "      <td>for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo   the killer   hard boiled   face off   appears to have made an exciting   elegant   charming spy thriller   kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american   read   unsophisticated   hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them    sadly   as the picture progresses   the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up   two hour long episode of magyuver    and not a particularly good one at that    what went wrong    mi2 begins flashily enough   that initial flash leading us to believe that it ll soon give way to something of a plot   but it only gives way to more flash   then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise s firing gun just so they can die really cool    early on   during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt   tom cruise   and nyah nordoff hall   thandie newton     woo works some of his trademark magic    in one hypnotic   though completely inexplicable sequence   the director slows the action down to a languid semi stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other s eyes with come hither sexuality       just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance   coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff    prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain   sans scaffolding   then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another    why    i haven t the foggiest    i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply    with mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine   the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects    it s possible that these   spies   could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off   though of course this is never explored    the scenes i ve described are really only included to titillate   not to give any insight into character    god forbid    woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic   but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial like visuals    still in terms of crackerjack eye candy   the opening has much to cherish    cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices   the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is      between the frantic dancing   woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact    the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way   yet it has style and something of soul   and woo casts a bit of a spell on us    sure it s all smoke and mirrors   but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product    thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that s about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez   george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight    they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres    newton bats her eyes flirtatiously    cruise grins a little too slyly    the cruise character   ethan hunt   has been drastically altered since the first film    here cruise plays him more as a hip   sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1    he s cool and dashing   which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut   which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film     and blustered his way through magnolia   quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90 s      sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise s initial   i m the man      charm and more slo mo close ups of his preening mug    mi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act   which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won t stop    the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle   the first gun fight in the film     which really should be unheard of in a john woo film   but alas this particular battle could ve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi   of course excepting the   symbolic   pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture      we ve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand    it isn t done any differently here    the action is pure hard target   broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind    he s cool for sure but he s made to be as empty as the movie    the actor isn t used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks   he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment   be it during a gunfight   before one or after one    when he s not beaming away   he s staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell   but woo s editing seriously undermines the effort    he fetishizes cruise s angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof    i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he s really austin powers    in a classic woo action moment   ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin up boy angel of death    the gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual   one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise   basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does      the lead bad guy   played by the appropriately british dougray scott   and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken       on motorcycles    though instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment   the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug   only to fly about a hundred feet   still in bear hug position     land on a beach below and begin a mano e mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a   so you thought i was dead            not to worry   cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat    what a hero    you may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2 s plot    my reasoning is simple   i m not sure of any good it would do    the film itself has absolutely no concern with story   only with hurtling forth to the next   special   effect    i wasn t kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video    nobody will go to this for the plot   and if they do they ll surely regret it    as summer movies evolve   or devolve   character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing    in mi   the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma s   that film s director   stylistic flourishes   while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo s non stop masturbatory pandemonium    it s irrelevant in every sense   as is character    all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors</td>\n",

       "      <td>mandingo   has traditionally been seen as one of two things   either a much needed revisionist look at slavery in the south   or in the words of film critic leonard maltin     a trashy potboiler   that   appeals only to the s m crowd      actually   i think   mandingo   is a strange combination of the two   although it fails on both fronts    it s too trashy to be good drama   but too dramatic to be good trash    the story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell   james mason   and his son   hammond   perry king      one day in new orleans   hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede   heavyweight boxer ken norton      although the movie never explains it   a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley    according to the movie   mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves    hammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him    hammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves    meanwhile   hammond has married his cousin   blanche   susan george     because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild    hammond   however   is happier spending nights with his   bed wench     the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex    it is quickly apparent that hammond   despite his overt racism   is more in love with his bed wench   a sensitive slave girl named ellen   brenda sykes     than he is with blanche    hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had   pleasured   her before he did    of course   it s fine that he s slept with numerous slave girls   but the fact that his wife   a   white lady     had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her    so blanche is usually left lonely and sex starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen    blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child    hammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half black child   although it s okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond     so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth   and hammond poisons blanche    hammond then finds mede   shoots him twice in the shoulder   and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water    yes   you read right   the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive    judging only by the plot     mandingo   is pure sexploitation    the main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible   with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society    when   mandingo   was released in 1975   it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail   this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs    dramatically     mandingo   is weak and unfocused   and historically it s mostly confused    if one were to judge history by this film   it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality   not economics    not once in the film do we see any of the slaves working   except for a few house servants    the men spend most of the time sitting around   while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner    there is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves   but   mandingo s   overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick   although there s plenty of violence    fights   vicious beatings   shootings   and the aforementioned human boiling sequence    thrown in for good measure      some tried to write off   mandingo   as a blaxploitation film   one of a number of quickly made   low budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies   but it s not that easy       mandingo   was studio financed by paramount pictures   and produced by dino de laurentiis   the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as   the bible     1966     the remake of   king kong     1976     and the ill fated   dune     1984      the director was richard fleischer   a veteran who was best known for several special effects laden action movies including   20   000 leagues under the sea     1954   and   fantastic voyage     1966     as well as such superior suspense films as   the narrow margin     1952      the script   based on the supermarket best seller by ken ostott   and the subsequent play by jack kirkland     was penned by norman wexler   who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on   serpico      james mason   perry king   and susan george were well known and respected actors   mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt     and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career    so why is   mandingo   so bad    a number of reasons   including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job    wexler s script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive   it combines stereotyped slave talk     yessuh   massuh       stereotyped southern white trash talk     fer whut re you gittin  outta bed         and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk     if you see me hang   you gonna know you killed a black brother          fleischer s direction is clumsy   especially during the fight scenes   and all the actors give weak performances   especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable    nevertheless   credit should be given where credit is due    despite its exploitative nature     mandingo   was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery    until then   there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery    even classics such as   gone with the wind     1939   can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter       mandingo   reassessed the south   and showed that it wasn t all beautiful plantations   green fields   and pretty sunsets    but all this is constantly undermined by the film s negligible point of view    it claims to see things from the black perspective   but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners    with a little more maturity and different handling     mandingo   might have been an effective   worthwhile film    while it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery   it never deals with them    the issues the movie brings up are worthwhile   but wexler s script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing    there is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner   but   mandingo   never does it    steven spielberg touched on that same topic in   schindler s list     1993     by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid    the difference between that film and   mandingo   is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair   unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma       mandingo   is satisfied to simply show some skin   and because of that   its   trashy potboiler   nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished</td>\n",

force within the world   or outside of it    these thought provoking questions are the subject of   final destination     which is the most riveting horror drama since 1999 s   the sixth sense      stylishly filmed and tautly directed by   x files   alum james wong   the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters   in accurately written   teen speak     rather than overwrought   highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldn t use     all the while developing into a darkly foreboding   severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the less successful   but still suspenseful epilogue    at the start of the film   17 year old high school senior alex browning   devon sawa   is about to leave with his 40 student french class for a field trip to paris    progressively getting a case of preflight jitters   he spots several mysterious   coincidences     including the departure time being 9   25   the same as his september 25 birthday   as well as hearing the john denver song   rocky mountain high   over the sound system in the airport bathroom       john denver died in a plane crash     alex grudgingly mutters to himself    once seated   alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff   and after causing a ruckus onboard   he   as well as six other students and a teacher   are thrown off    arguing in the airport lobby   alex s suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight   killing all 300  passengers   including the rest of their classmates    as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode   the fellow survivors   whom he has saved   treat him in varying manners    carter   kerr smith     the hotshot jock   holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate    alex s best friend   tod   chad e   donella     wants to stand by him but can t because of his fearful parents    the teacher   mrs   lewton   kristen cloke     is frightened by him   believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster   as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker    only outsider clear rivers   ali larter     who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alex s premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before   is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life    that is only the setup of   final destination     and the less said about what follows   the better    suffice to say   the film does   indeed   turn into a slasher film   albeit one that is more thoughtful than most   and replaces a knife wielding maniac for the never seen granddaddy killer of them all   the grim reaper itself    the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes   and   final destination   surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years    graphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner   they manage to occasionally be so intense you don t know whether to shrink down in your seat   tap your feet in nervousness   or turn away    devon sawa   a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 1999 s underseen slasher comedy     idle hands     is even more of a charismatic presence here    the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival   which he comes to believe he wasn t meant to do   as well as the loss of the other passengers   is superbly and subtly acted on his part    one scene   in which he is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful    ali larter   1999 s   varsity blues       in the other central role   is also effective   as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before   leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man  the exact opposite of her now deceased father    the other roles are not as fully written   and most remain rather one dimensional    the movie is mainly sawa s   however   and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles    tony todd   1992 s   candyman       as an arcane morgue attendant   pops up for a five minute cameo   but his appearance is rather supererogatory    and the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye   while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy    ultimately   what is so good about   final destination   is that   within the confines of the slasher genre   writer director wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner   and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frighten  two things that are rarely found in today s horror films    if anything   it s safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again</td>\n",

rickman   chris rock   kevin smith   jason mewes   jason lee   george carlin   alanis morissette    running time   130 minutes  being a huge fan of kevin smith   i was expecting a lot out of his newest project  dogma     it might just be kevin s best work to date    it s very funny with smart and foul mouthed dialogue while unexpectedly it has a serious undertone to it and besides going against god and jesus christ   it actually tries to tell people that there is such a thing rather than that there isn t    in 1994 a little  27   000 movie premiered at sundance    this little film was called  clerks  and this little film went on to become a huge video sensation    you really can t meet a person on this green earth who has not seen  clerks     it was hailed by critics as one of the best movies of the year and soon a sequel is coming    in 1995 kevin made another movie  mallrats  that flopped horribly   thought it was not the best movie ever made it was a pretty good little flick    it was panned by critics but hailed by audiences and in 1997  chasing amy  came out and was kevin s biggest success to date    now in 1999 we get a great little movie by the name of  dogma     wow   what a cast    ok here is the plot in this movie   linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic    one day at her house metatron   the voice of god   appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels   matt damon and ben affleck   from getting back into heaven by ways of a church    ok now get this   she is told to find two prophets   one who talks a lot and one who doesn t   however she gets jay and silent bob instead   who give us great performances      now on her way to new jersey with jay and silent bob to try and stop the two angels the 13th apostle falls out of the sky   chris rock   and helps guide her to find these angels    salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way    azrael   jason lee   who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win    bethany   linda fiorentino   has to now use the help of all these people to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith    what a movie   it is everything rolled into one   an offensive   offbeat   smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end   and ends up being a feel good movie    who would have known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself    now for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart    yes it may target the catholic community and bash them a lot   but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven   it actually goes with god and kevin gives a message that there is a god    this review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie    kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie    of course the best   and funniest   of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob    probably the best characters in movies that i like    the star studded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin   jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while    the script was written by kevin smith with many f words in there of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what isn t and makes us laugh at the same time as we think    chris rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well   with some classic lines    linda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is    of course jason mewes and kevin smith do a great job as jay and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay   as well as silent bob      alan rickman   jason lee   salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon and ben affleck in the starring roles    being oscar winners for the classic  good will hunting  they give great performances here again but matt damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he could    ben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story    the movie s only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it    however the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members    dogma  stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to  clerks     while being funny at times   in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but can t deny it     dogma  will offend people   especially deeply religious people   but for those of you who are open minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you    all kevin smith fans must see</td>\n",

movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face    this movie stinks out loud    quite frankly   this movie deserves a    but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny    so i m giving it a    and maybe that is too generous    right from the opening credits   i knew that i had a class a bomb on my hands    not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting   but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform    i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening   it does get explained later   and as soon as the first scene is over   we cut to a completely unrelated scene    to be honest   as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was   i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film    with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film   it wouldn t have surprised me if the opening had never been explained    so what is this movie about    you ask    like it really matters    ok   here goes    this all girl band headed by kelly macnamara   dolly reed   and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry    once there   they do manage to find success   due as much to their hooters as anything else   it sure wasn t for their brutally bad singing voices     and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them    everything from big egos   to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral    there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure   but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing     from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here    other than the above mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have    the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts    mr   ebert has generously thrown in helpings of   hey man       dig   and my all time favorite      this is my happening   and it freaks me out      now i ask you   with lines like that how can you go wrong    ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue    maybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter    i don t know   but all the big words in the world wouldn t be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting    but the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie    i ve seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey    in fact   there is one scene    the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes    during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries    add to the directing and writing the music in this movie    i almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken   there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers    then we have the cast    first lets start david gurian who played harris   the manager of the band    this has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera    sadly   his acting doesn t come close to making up for his looks    if you have been following along up to this point   this shouldn t surprise you    meyer s stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets    dolly reed plays kelly   the leader of the band    and no surprise here   she was cast for her cup size   not her talents    and yes   she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents    sadly   her ass is almost as large as her chest    hey   it a sexist movie   so i m writing a sexist review    then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey   one of the other band members    this goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie    meyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all   but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all    sure russ   now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows    on the up side   she does have a fun lesbo scene    i sound like i m writing a review in a porn magazine    but hey   i ll admit it   the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked    and since that was a huge disappointment   i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey    the only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it    unless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too    and if you are thinking of checking it out for the double d s    you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet    this is a movie that should be avoided at all costs    an even better idea might be to require video stores to place a warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls    beware   this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense    proceed with extreme caution</td>\n",

       "0    you leave little notes on my pillow    i told you a million times i can t stand little notes on my pillow     we are all out of corn flakes   f   u      it took me three hours to figure out that  f   u     was felix unger          a frustrated oscar madison   walter matthau   running down a list of his complaints against his roommate felix unger   jack lemmon     in the odd couple    the classic neil simon comedy   based on his own stage play   about suicidal felix   lemmon     who is persuaded by his poker friend oscar   matthau   to stay with him in his apartment after felix s wife throws him out and files for divorce    the hook   oscar is messy and likes his apartment that way   while felix is an obsessive compulsive neat freak    the two men   despite their friendship   instantly clash    movies just aren t as delightfully funny as this one is    every line of neil simon s dialogue flows like comedic poetry   and all the actors are just perfect in their performances    lemmon is at his best as the anxiety ridden felix   but it s matthau who shines brightest as oscar   whose world is being invaded and rearranged   mostly against his wishes   the type of character i always enjoy identifying with      and who can forget that catchy score by neal hefti    the best thing about the film   and this is a testament to the quality of the writing   is that it s a comedy with substance    these two men   even while at each other s throats   genuinely care for one another as friends    when they clash   it isn t cartoonish hatred being displayed   but genuine frustration with the fact that they are such good friends but just cannot manage to co exist    movies nowadays   take grumpy old men for example   just don t have that extra spark there    these days it s just animosity for the sake of comedy    a television series followed   starring jack klugman and tony randall     which i ll admit i ve never seen an episode of in its entirety   and neil simon even scripted the sequel   the odd couple ii   which was released in 1998    neither of them compare to this comic masterpiece though    it s one of the best comedies of all time and easily earns its spot in my top ten favorite films

       "1    the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending    watching one of these movies   everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise    when the film ends   there is a moment of confusion   then recollection   then some more confusion   then possibly a second viewing for clarification    this is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more    good surprises make movies fun to watch    then there are the bad twists    you either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie   i m talking about you reindeer games   or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid    screwed perfectly suits the latter description    what starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much going on    by the writers of man on the moon and the people vs    larry flynt   scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take a stab at film directing    whoops    screwed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments    norm macdonald stars as willard filmore   a hard working chauffeur who just wants a little respect from his rich   old   insidious boss   miss crock   elaine stritch      when he overhears her plans to fire him on christmas day   willard is convinced by his best friend rusty   dave chapelle   to kidnap crock s beloved dog and hold it for a ransom of one million dollars    too excited to pay any attention   the hapless losers  plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home    now crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends   realizing they can make even more money   decide to stage the fake kidnapping    of course   everything that could go wrong does    the first forty five minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment   a guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad    but the convoluted script eventually builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear    the more idiotic these characters get   the more reckless the script becomes    at one point   i wanted to get out of my seat and yell at these characters     no   you idiot      i m not just talking about willard and rusty   who were extremely annoying   i m also talking about the cops in this film    a monkey could have solved this case within an hour but these guys   headed by murder one s daniel benzali   were just too clueless to forgive    they give real cops bad names    also poor danny devito apparently does not know how to turn down a role these days    looking almost identical to his penguin in batman   returns   every time he appeared on the screen i had to shake my head in disbelief    he just didn t belong in this movie    macdonald and chapelle are veterans at these kinds of movies but devito made the film much worse than it already was   gross out humor is certainly not his forte    if you re a fan of norm macdonald s other chaotic comedy   dirty work   you might actually love this near sequel    otherwise   don t get screwed out of your hard earned money

       "2    towards the middle of   the sweet hereafter     a crowded school bus skids on an icy road surface as it rounds a bend   careens through the steel guard rail   and disappears out of sight    then   in long shot   we see the vehicle slowly sliding across what looks like a snow covered field    it pauses for a moment before the   field   cracks under the bus  weight and the bright yellow vehicle vanishes in an effortless moment   a single smooth second of time    compare that scene   if you will   to the last eighty minutes of   titanic     when the behemoth sinks slowly and spectacularly to its watery demise   and you ll appreciate the futility of comparing greatness in films    the scene in   the sweet hereafter   epitomizes all that s right with independent canadian

mitchell stephens   a wonderfully moving performance by ian holm     who comes to sam dent to persuade the townsfolk to engage in a class action suit    stephens   who   doesn t believe in accidents     functions as a concerned   involved observer   scribbling details in his notebook and providing the parents with an opportunity to reach some kind of closure in the harrowing aftermath    while

       "3    the   submarine   genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing and compelling types of storytelling there is    think about it        these films are completely based in reality   yet only a handful of people have ever been on one   making them fascinating to the general public    they aren t like movies that take place on a plane or a train   as anybody can get on one of those    and they aren t like movies that happen in outer space either   because no one s done any of that stuff yet    when a new one comes out   you don t hear anyone say   ugh   another submarine movie   like people tend to say   ugh   another boxing movie      look at modern movies that involve submarines   das boot   the abyss   the hunt for red october   crimson tide        all are well regarded as top notch entertainment    gladly joining that bunch is u 571   which stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of a u   s   naval submarine during world war ii    we learn he has been denied a recommendation for his own command by his superior   bill paxton      mcconaughey s crew then receives orders that they will be boarding a disabled german submarine to steal the enigma   a german communications encoding device that has stumped allied intelligence    the mission goes horribly wrong however   and as a result   mcconaughey and only a handful of his crew   as well as a captured german   become trapped aboard the u 571 in enemy waters    the first great thing about u 571 is the film s opening sequence    the german crew of u 571 are under attack   which sets the events of the rest of the film into motion    it s tense   exciting and fascinating    and i applaud the filmmakers for not copping out and instead keeping the entire sequence in german with english subtitles    most movies with a scene this long would have panicked and had the german crew speaking english right away    once the plot gets moving   u 571 gives us action sequence after action sequence   making the audience wonder   ok   now how do they get out of this        the stakes keep raising   much like in executive decision   an excellent action thriller     and even though the audience knows how the film will end   it s a lot of fun getting there    i only have two minor complaints about the entire film    the first comes from the scenes which follow the opening sequence    while their purpose is to introduce us to the characters and to get the story going   which they do     i feel as though it could have been done much quicker   and less conventionally    i mean   did we really have to see the ship s crew at a wedding    because of that   you now know exactly what s going to happen to the groom    my other gripe would be during the film s finale    there s an explosion which ends the film that is one of the weakest looking cgi effects since the president s plane crashed into the ocean at the end of air force one    i cannot stress this enough        until a cgi effect can be made to look like a model effect   stick with using models    yes   u 571 is historically incorrect and there are surely some specifics in the plot that people who have been onboard a submarine will tell you   that couldn t happen     but the overall point of this film is entertainment    it succeeds fantastically     pg 13

       "4    a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings    a prime example of this is 1999 s 10 things i hate about you   which was basically the taming of the shrew in a high school    less successful was last year s adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp   here the setting was the corporate world of new york    now comes o   a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeare s tragedies    like 10 things i hate about you   the stage is a high school   a private prep school where odin james   mekhi phifer   is the on court general   the basketball team s standout player    julia stiles   featured in 10 things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawke s hamlet   plays desi brable   odin s girlfriend   whose father also happens to be dean of the institution    josh hartnett   pearl harbor   is on hand for the villainy   playing the scheming hugo   who sets the tragic wheels in motion    o was actually filmed a couple of years ago   but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy    the movie   directed by tim blake nelson   best known for his co starring role in o brother   where art thou      and written by brad kaaya   is very grim    an air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits    and that is how it should be    of all of shakespeare s tragedies   othello is the most harrowing   not because of any body count   but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago   whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery    kaaya s profane filled script   after all   these are high school kids   does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts    the young man considers himself the basketball team s prime utility man who does a little bit of everything   pass   shoot   rebound   but is constantly in the shadow of odin    plus his father   the team s coach   played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen   showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood    the script follows the familiar lines of the classic    hugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desi s fidelity   eroding the star s confidence in those he considers closest to him   affecting both his relationships and his game    it all ends in blood   of course   which is why the movie was originally shelved    the performances in o vary    phifer is at first cocky and self assured   emotions he handles with ease    he also does quite well displaying odin s darker side   his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution   his growing distrust of those he loved   his rage and the erosion of his belief system    hartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit   turning friend against friend   and lover against lover    stiles seems a bit stilted   but occasionally also rises to the occasion   moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight    the film does contain a few missteps   a subplot involving hugo s theft of the school mascot is left hanging    also desi s actions concerning michael   andrew keegan     odin s former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugo s machinations   is puzzling    why she would continually be seen with michael   however innocent the circumstances   when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back    it is irrational    but these are minor carpings    overall   o is a stylish and faithful adaptation    if nothing else   it may encourage some people to read the original text   and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature

       "5    this movie was one of the first american films done by director paul verhoeven    he has done films since then such as basic instict and starship troopers    all of his movies have one main thing in common  they don t skimp on the violence    in a verhoeven movie a guy doesn t get shot once in the chest  he gets shot many times all over the body    robocop takes place in detroit in the future    things are pretty bleak    the company ocp rules the city with an iron fist and is moving in on running the police force    peter weller plays a cop who goes on a mission with his partner   nancy allen    peter weller goes in an empty room alone and gets killed    meanwhile ocp has a failed demonstration of a ed 209 model robot crime fighter    someone comes up with the idea of having a cyborg robocop so they use any parts worth scalvaging from peter weller and make him into the robocop the movie is titled after    the plot of this movie generally runs at a decent pace    it drags a bit towards the end with robocop wanting to finish everybody off   but plot twists keep it exciting    the acting is bad from weller when he is human   but very good when he is robocop    nancy allen does a decent job    this movie doesn t leave itself open for a sequel exactly    but they made one anyway    enter        robocop 2 starring   peter weller and nancy allen directed by   irvin kershner  detroit is in a more bleak state than it was in the first film    ocp is trying to develop an improved  robocop 2  that will be more than a match for criminals    most of the police force is on strike due to ocp taking it over   leaving robocop to be the police force in the city    this film is pretty bizaare    it has a 13 year old drug lord who curses as much as eddie murphy   even more violence than the original   and some more humor    the plot of this movie is pretty large   almost too much so    there are three or four plot lines weaving around that don t really match up    the effects are still decent though    this sequel isn t more of the same really   just a darker version robocop dealing more with drugs than with armed criminals    if you liked the first one   watch this    but be dissapointed    so later comes        robocop 3 starring nancy allen and robert john burke  ocp is now owned by a large japanese company    robocop joins a band of rebels to counter attack the evil empire   i mean ocp    the japanese send a cyborg ninja to deal with robocop    among other things        this movie is easier to follow than the last one    which means the plot isn t quite as crowded    this movie isn t anything special though    just more of robocop blasting things up in a more kid friendly way    really not reccomended

       "6    where do i begin    okay   how about with this   starship troopers is one of the worst movies to hit theaters in a long time    in fact   it might even be the worst   major   release film to come out in years        or even a decade    this is bad beyond belief    i would   not   suggest paying money to see this    there s a good chance you ll regret it    if you see it for free   you could still want to walk out    go right ahead    the movie starts off with cheesy 90210 scenes set in the future world of       buenos aires    here we meet the group of horrendously bad actors and actresses playing obnoxious   easy to    despise    with a passion characters that have love triangles   love rectangles   and love hexagons screwing up their life    before long they all go off and join the military   primarily in the interest of having sex with the other youngsters that joined    they train    they strut around nude for no reason whatsoever    after an hour of making the audience scream in agony   they start fighting bugs    the big bugs look nice   even though their design is only   okay      unfortunately   the fights are boring since we   want   all of the characters dead anyway    cue more agony    then some characters have sex    then some more die           who cares              cue more agony    the movie ends   the audience runs out to their cars   vomits over the pavement   and attempts to drive home    unfortunately   after that torture   they can t think straight   don t pay attention to the road   and many are in ugly car wrecks    you remember how batman   robin was bad    well   batman   robin kicked this movie s sorry butt   people    starship troopers does not succeed as an action movie    it does not succeed as a drama    it does not succeed as a war movie    it does not succeed as a comedy    it does not succeed as a satire    it does not succeed as a parody    it succeeds as being horrible    terrible    gut wrenchingly bad    i wanted to run away from that movie every minute    but i paid my money and i owed it to others to see if the movie got any better    so i stayed    it never got better    frequently   it did the impossible   and got   worse      the movie as written   acted   directed   and basically just feels as a whole like it s about on the mental maturity level of a free willy 4   the whole thing feels like a movie that only three year olds could enjoy        except for the ridiculously gratuitous blood and gore   and pointless nudity    it s written for little children   but children should definitely   not   go anywhere near it    of course   i recommend the same for everyone    don t go anywhere near it    verhoeven s got a streak going now    his last movie was showgirls    he seems to be trying to see how bad his movies can get before people finally stop coming    showgirls was a failure   but it appears that   though it ll be lucky to make near its budget   this movie will still do okay gross wise    is it really   all   bad    well   no    troopers has about four or five lines of dialouge short humorous scenes that are actually funny   mostly from the   do you want to know more      commercials that pop up throughout the story   promoting the joys of the joining the troopers    so that adds up to about 30 seconds of entertainment and still about one hour   59 minutes   and 30 seconds of miserable torture    i m totally confused as to the way that some people are really enjoying this movie    but i do admit it    so   if you re willing to possibly put yourself through torture   go ahead and see it   and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it    i don t know how anyone or any   thing   could love this movie   but hey   to each his own    feel free to give it a shot    of course   in the interest of saving your souls   i don t recommend it    but guess what    alien resurrection comes out november 26th   and   having already seen some of it and having read the script   i assure you that it will blow pretty much everyone away    though opinion on starship troopers is reasonably split   it ll be difficult to find someone that   won t   like alien resurrection when they ve seen it    this is possibly the year s best intense action film   or at least   one   of the best    if you really want to see alien warfare that s played out intelligently and seriously   see alien resurrection    please   avoid this

and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind    ralph fiennes is the title character   an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory   and particularly the memory of love   is the ostensible focus of the film    but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together   we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him    his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld    the same can easily be said for every other character in the film   of which there are too many    juliette binoche s nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart    at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her   and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious   disfigured   dying stranger    even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion   however   that it verges on the comical    with so many characters enjoying so little screen time   the film s 160 minutes can be taxing    yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn t help but feel that greatness was in the air    hints of it were everywhere    in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover   in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern day swimmer in the sahara   in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war    there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years    but ultimately the emotional truths writer director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed    in the end   i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron   a haunting bore    bore is perhaps too strong a word    but after drinking in the rich production values   the cup remains only slightly over half full

       "8    written by john grisham and robert altman   as al hayes    directed by robert altman  some time ago   a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel    the novel was a summer smash   topping best seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads    the only problem   the novel wasn t very good    it was far more pulp than pulitzer    but the director realized that   no matter how pedestrian the prose   this book really grabbed people   that the author   while not a great writer   was a fantastic storyteller    so he took on the project   convinced he could make something happen on screen    the director    francis ford coppola    the book   of course   was mario puzo s the godfather    the rest   as they say in showbiz   was history    by bringing up the godfather   i don t mean to suggest that robert altman s the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness    but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material    can you get any more questionable than john grisham    depends on whom you ask    but there s no question that grisham s work grabs people    like puzo   grisham is a better storyteller than a writer   unlike fellow hack michael crichton   who is a good idea man but who can t tell a well constructed story from a can of spam    so something in grisham s unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman   who at 73 years old remains one of america s greatest living filmmakers    the result is a gripping thriller that   while falling short of classic cinema   deserves its place in the altman canon     from its opening shot to the closing credits   the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread   with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe    this terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch    witness said opening shot   we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing   undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear    we roll over the hills into the town of savannah   then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone    right away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises    pay attention   boys and girls   this shot was not conceived by john grisham   but by altman    this is what a great director can do for questionable source material    the sports car belongs to rick magruder   kenneth branagh     the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases    magruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office    outside after the party he meets one of the waitresses   mallory doss   embeth davidzt     just as she realizes her car has been stolen    driven by southern chivalry   a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress   magruder offers her a ride home    there he learns more about mallory s life than he bargained for    her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon   robert duvall     a ted kyzynski style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter    magruder   perhaps influenced by mallory s decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him   is sympathetic to her plight   and offers to help her get her father committed   right after he sleeps with her   of course    this simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end    he succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital   and for a moment all appears well    but then dixon s crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup   and suddenly magruder finds himself   mallory and his own children in danger    the cops won t lift a finger to help a liberal attorney    his only allies are his faithful assistant lois   daryl hannah   and his bumbling private eye sidekick clyde   robert downey jr      if this predicament wasn t bad enough   hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos    altman may provide the atmosphere   but branagh s performance holds the gingerbread man together    an accomplished actor when he isn t directing himself in vanity productions   branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives    is his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness   or of egotism    magruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it   and by then it s too late    as the plot unfolds   magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are    and life is never so bad that it can t get worse    if you re familiar with altman s work   you ll recognize several of his signature techniques    characters are not introduced in establishing shots   but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent    crucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows   making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action    dialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style    and of course there s my favorite altman technique   the obligatory nude actress shot    thanks to altman   here are some of the actresses i ve had the pleasure of seeing naked   sally kellerman   julianne moore   madeline stowe   even frances mcdormand    and now i can add embeth davidtz   who looks quite healthy in the altogether    the naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film    is it old school sexism   or a clever in joke    you be the judge    but back to the picture at hand    in the hands of a mere mortal   the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller   no better or worse than the countless others we ve all endured    in the hands of a master like altman   it becomes an exercise in existential doom   in its own way far more successful than scorsese s cape fear remake   which tried for the same result    what may prevent it from enduring with altman s greatest work is a weak third act   in fact   there really is no third act in grisham s story   so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up    but there are true moments of riveting suspense   and great performances by branagh   davidzt and downey jr   more than enough to see you through    that polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman   and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back   should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are    they probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill    and that   my friends   should make you very afraid

       "9       a man is not a man without eight taels of gold      starring sammo hung   sylvia chang   directed by mabel cheung   written by cheung and alex law   cinematography by bill wong  eight taels of gold begins as a fish out of water story and at some point becomes a love story involving two people whose past choices prevent the fruition of their love    neither aspect of the movie is entirely successful   but both are good enough    and along the way there is one perfect scene   which is one more than you find in most films    slim   played by portly sammo hung   better known as a star and director of hong kong action movies   is a chinese immigrant who drives a yellow cab in new york    when the movie opens   we see him shouting obscenities at another taxi driver    he does not seem particularly out of place    in fact   he is about to return to visit his home in rural china for the first time in sixteen years   spending most of his life savings in the process   and it is there that he will become the proverbial fish out of water   as he realizes that you can never go home    he brings with him some statue of liberty cigarette lighters   cheap sunglasses   and lobsters   which have to be large   to prove they re american     the tokens of his success    he also wears a gold chain and a gold watch   because without eight taels of gold   a man is not a man   my dictionary tells me that taels are a unit of weight used in the far east   and i assume the phrase is a chinese proverb      he loses most of this stuff  except the gold  when his van crashes into a river and he has to hitch a ride   so to speak   on a raft along the river which runs past his parents  village    when he arrives unannounced   he almost induces cardiac arrest in his father    all of this has the makings of a routine comedy   and the movie has its amusing moments   as when the villagers take turns giving slim gifts during a celebration of his homecoming   and they all give him birds   so by evening s end he is surrounded by turkeys   ducks   geese and other sundry fowl    but eight taels is not a comedy  it is a sad   sweet story about the choices people make   and how they are sometimes irreparable    director mabel cheung   an autumn s tale   the soong sisters   sees clearly what it is like to have lived half of your life in one country and half in a country on the other side of the world  what it is like to no longer have a place to call home    slim does not belong in china   nor does he belong in america   where he can barely speak the language    seeing water buffalo in the fields and rafts poled down the river and fireworks exploding gloriously in the sky over a small village   we come to know the world slim left behind   and it seems as if he too is knowing it for the first time   and wishes it felt more like home    the condition of the expatriate is eloquently portrayed   i   being one   was sympathetic    on his way to his parent s village   slim hooks up with jenny   sylvia chang     whom he knew when she was a girl nicknamed odds and ends   which is what he continues to call her   although she is now a mature   professional   attractive woman   to be married in the spring to an american chinese man    slim and odds and ends fall for each other    that s predictable    the manner in which their   non    romance is played out is not    the emotions involved are adult and complex   and the film avoids cheap solutions to their dilemma    it s typical   for instance   that the fianc   in this sort of plot be a colossal jerk   because it makes it easier to empathize with the unrequited lover    but here the fianc   is a decent   ordinary guy   and although slim would like to feel anger   he cannot    the fianc   has done nothing wrong   the situation is the result of bad luck or bad decisions   take your pick    eight taels has its share of flaws   the early sequences in america and on the plane to china are especially weak     but it compensates with insight    when odds and ends tells slim that her future husband wants to move to san francisco   she notes resignedly     it s all the same    wherever we go   we ll be in chinatown     and her straightforward statement expresses much    there is insight   too   in the understanding of the consequences of slim and odds and ends  decisions   he to move to america   she to marry a chinese american    both their choices were perhaps born of impatience   perhaps of a sense that the grass is always greener  and it turns out that both choices were wrong    but they cannot undo them   they must live with what they have done    such is life    the movie is tender toward these people   but it offers no false comforts    everything that is right and true about eight taels comes together in one great scene   which is the culmination of the love story    slim and odds and ends sit in a secluded spot and talk hesitantly   with the muted pop pop of fireworks exploding in the night behind them   and it seems the conversation will lead to a kiss    the exchange that follows   and what slim then does   is poignant and perfect   with clarity and understatement   we see two people s lives   their heartbreaks and virtues   summed up in a single moment    yes   the film is flawed   but moments like that justify most of its inadequacies

       "10   every once in a while   when an exceptional family film comes along   i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been   with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children   it is remarkable how many non disney films disappear in a couple of weeks    now i see that in so doing   i have unfairly ghettoized these films    so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents   but to anyone who wants to support smart   funny   energetic film making   see matilda    see it in a theater   rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video    see the best film i have seen in 1996    not the best children s film       the  best film    period    based on a story by roald dahl   it tells of young matilda wormwood   mara wilson     an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents   harry   danny devito     a crooked used car salesman   and zinnia   rhea perlman     a simple minded bingo addict    the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists   and when they do   it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books    when they finally do send her to school   it is to crunchem hall   a bleak place run by cruel   child hating miss agatha trunchbull   pam ferris      but things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher   miss honey   embeth davidtz     who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness    matilda also discovers another special talent    the ability to move things with her mind    which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull s cruelty    it was this spring s james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them   and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda    and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton   matilda soars on the cock eyed direction of danny devito    devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses   and he contributes some memorable images    in one scene   an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig tails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer   later   an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert    matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale    it is also characteristic of the best children s tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don t realize that they are learning them    there is a hilarious moment when matilda s television addicted father snatches away the book she is reading   in a wicked joke   he thinks  moby dick  is pornographic   and forces her to watch an inane game show   hosted by jon lovitz   in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around    matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment   and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child    that because   i m big and you re little   i m right and you re wrong      more specifically   it has as its heroine an intelligent   self confident girl who struggles successfully against other people s notions of how she should behave    it is no coincidence that matilda was co written by robin swicord   who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women    finally   matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment   it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word    devito knows enough to make matilda fast paced and appealing to children   taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy   including a great chase through her dark house    the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable   with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character    but there are also many   many delights for adults   including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda s classmates recite in sing song fashion   there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda s father    i can t imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted    matilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling    i will see it again   and years from now i will watch it with my children    and now i will stop   because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin   and there is a seat in that theater you should be in   if you have a child or ever were a child

       "11   swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults    steven spielberg may not have directed   he only executive produced   but his touch certainly is evident in this movie    and he knows a money making winner when he sees one    the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster   big action   funny comedy   and the pacing of a rollercoaster    hopkins plays don diego de la vega   otherwise known as zorro    a fighter for the people   he is eventually captured by don rafael montero   stuart wilson     who also   unintentionally   kills his wife    the film cuts to twenty years later   where vega still wants to montero dead    however   he s far too old now   and trains up thief alejandro murrieta   banderas   to become the new zorro    banderas motive    to avenge the death of his brother   who was killed at the hands of captain love   matthew letscher   who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar   in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie    with the scene set   the movie goes on full blast   with sword fights a plenty and witty one liners    banderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorro s   playing each other off with ease    hopkins seems to come off a little better   but banderas does some excellent work    as the bad guys   wilson and letscher seem one dimensional   but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way    the audience does hate them   which can t be bad    catherine zeta jones also pops up as hopkins daughter   and although she provides little more than the usual female lead   she delivers a charming   but one note   performance    the chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones    there s a delightful little scene where banderas and jones have a sword fight   and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed   until jones clothes fall off all together    the director   fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye   1995   handles the film perfectly    the action is well done and fast paced   the comedy put across well    the cast help a lot   but the direction is still outstanding    although the film is very long   the plot keeps chugging along   and there s barely a dull moment    however   the film is a little over indulgent   and it could have been trimmed    it manages to hold the attention   thankfully   and the adventure and charm holds right up to the last reel    screenwriters john eskow   ted elliot and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched and one dimensional script    although they ve bought zorro up to date with big explosions and wild action   the plot itself is barely existent    there s lots of little sub plots hanging around   but there s nothing substantial to bring them all together    the main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to  buy  california using gold stolen from the guy he s buying the land off    this sets up for a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines    however   this doesn t seem to appear until nearly over a hour into the film   so the film is never quite sure where it s going    in the end however   zorro provides action and comedy in spades    it suitable for everyone   so put the guilt behind   and put some more money into spielbergs bank account    you won t regret it

       "12      showgirls   is the first big budget   big studio film to receive an nc 17 rating    and its release last year came at a time when senator bob dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence    but if   showgirls   is any indication of hollywood s future   the folks in washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to american values  bad moviemaking       showgirls   is a relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene   and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter    director paul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas   who collaborated on another shock value project   1992 s   basic instinct     follow the plight of a young woman   teen tv star elizabeth berkley   determined to make a name for herself as a topless dancer    it s a hackneyed premise to begin with   so not surprisingly   all of the stock characters are trucked out    there s the demanding producer    the loyal friend    the bitchy competitor    lest i forget the scummy club owner    of course   any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the film s main attraction  an endless parade of full frontal nudity    unfortunately     showgirls   doesn t satisfy in this department    verhoeven s slam bang   in your face style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic    to make matters worse   you ll be forced to sit through the movie s clothed scenes   which don t cover up for laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history    verhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground   but if it s adult entertainment you want   stay home and watch the playboy channel    you ll be the wiser for it

       "13   good films are hard to find these days    great films are beyond rare    proof of life   russell crowe s one two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller   is one of those rare gems    a taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting   an intelligent script   and masterful directing   together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days   genuine motivation in a story that rings true    consider the strange coincidence of russell crowe s character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan s character in the film    all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world    i haven t seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah s masterpiece   the getaway    but enough with the gossip   let s get to the review    the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman   david morse     an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti government soldiers    upon discovering his identity   the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for  6 million    the only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off   and no one will step forward with the money    with no choice available to her   bowman s wife alice   ryan   hires terry thorne   crowe     a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative   to arrange the return of her husband    but when things go wrong    as they always do in these situations    terry and his team   which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year   david caruso   take matters into their own hands    the film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character driven vehicle filled with well written dialogue   shades of motivation   and convincing acting by all the actors    the script is based on both a book   the long march to freedom   and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap ransom situations   and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy   screenwriter of the devil s advocate and dolores claiborne    the biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan   but that between crowe and david caruso    dug out from b movie hell   caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe s right hand gun while providing most of the film s humor    ryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes   david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him   and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic   gunslinger character of terry thorne    the most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes    the bulk of those scenes   which bookend the movie   work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story s characters    the scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise    director taylor hackford mixes both his old school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film    proof of life is a thinking man s action movie    it is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war   and the sacrifices one makes for those choices    the sacrifices that help you sleep at night

       "14   depending on your degree of cinematic acumen   last man standing is either a   a prohibition era remake of akira kurosawa s 1961 classic yojimbo   b   a prohibition era remake of sergio leone s 1964 classic a fistful of dollars   c   a prohibition era action drama with a completely original story line    new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category   c   than in the other two combined   much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons    the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing   which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the  real  source material   the dashiell hammett novel  red harvest     it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself    this time around   the man with no name is played by bruce willis   a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico    by all appearances   jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town   with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border    one is headed by an irishman named doyle   david patrick kelly     the other is run by chicago connected italian mobster strozzi   ned eisenberg      calling himself john smith   the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict   and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle s side    but smith s allegiance is as uncertain as his name   and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them    viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint   and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes cum bastardizations    there is the happily ineffectual lawman   bruce dern     the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses  affections   karina lombard     the barkeep who becomes our anti hero s only friend   william sanderson     suspicious lieutenants   christopher walken and michael imperioli   to question the bosses  trust in smith   a brutal beating   and a big fire    director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids   including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity   but at least he doesn t try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture    what he  does  do is nearly as big a mistake   and that is to provide a running voice over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard boiled style of pulp detective fiction    yes   that narration is full of cliches   but those are are not particularly troubling    the problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters    they were a mystery   to the other characters in the film and to the audience   their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted   and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status    with john smith s voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought   he becomes more mundane   just another tough guy trying to stay alive    it feels like a hammett novel   all right   and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice   but it simply doesn t work    the narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence   and the man with no name takes  no one  into his confidence    even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate   i can t imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction    willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith   but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else    christopher walken plays doyle s brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft spoken psychos   and there isn t another single character whom makes even the slightest impression    with no compelling antagonist for smith   there is no build up towards the expected showdown   and when it does come   that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about    cinematographer lloyd ahern   who also did the only noteworthy work on hill s 1995 flop wild bill   creates some nifty sunburned vistas   but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter productive narration    sometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original   they ll wonder what all the talk was about    in the case of last man standing   it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about

lay claim to that    he s in   there s something about mary     which i   still   haven t seen    and he s in the acerbic   your friends   neighbors     playing a talkative   sexually frustrated drama coach called jerri    now there s   permanent midnight     in which stiller plays another jerry   this one a heroin addicted television writer   last name stahl    there s also something about this

emma   and   brassed off     received greater respect and admiration for his mind blowing realization as renton in danny boyle s transatlantic junk fest     trainspotting      the philosophy appears to be a simple one   if you want  em to be taken seriously   make  em do drugs       permanent midnight   is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl   a successful hollywood writer who   in the mid eighties   had a  5   000 a week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a  6   000 a week heroin habit    a habit   in stahl s own words     the size of utah      as stahl   stiller contributes a commanding performance    unlike   trainspotting     which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse     permanent midnight   instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance    one of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to   naked lunch   author william s   burroughs who   when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds     so i can shave      stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in   permanent midnight     it s so he can talk to his mother on the phone   show up for work on time   even pay his bills    while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl   the writing   adapted from stahl s autobiography by director david veloz   is controlled and pointed       permanent midnight   shows how stahl moved from new york to l   a   to  again in the author s words     escape the drug scene     yeah   right     why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec   elizabeth hurley   so impossibly polite you d swear her single profanity was dubbed     and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings    stahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty   norristown s own maria bello   with whom he spent some rehab time    janeane garofalo is wasted  and miscast  as a heavily bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped up wordsmith   and that s stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor    stiller   unshaven   burroughs take note   and with lots of mascara around the eyes   has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck but   to his credit   never once pushes his pill popping   needle jabbing

       "16   it s a curious thing   i ve found that when willis is not called on to carry the whole movie   he s much better and so is the movie    even though   in the sixth sense he is the   name     he doesn t have the pivotal role    that honour goes to haley osment who plays cole sear   cute pun   seer   a 9 year old boy who can see ghosts    if osment was cute or precious   the director going for the maudlin   this would be nothing more than a movie of the week   thankfully   osment is not only better than that   but in some instances   blows everyone else off the screen in a bravura performance    we get to see his fears   vulnerabilities   strengths and intelligence which makes the sixth sense one of the best movies i ve seen this year    the whole cast matches him in quality   with willis giving a fairly low key performance that matches the subject matter    one thing about this movie   its target    this isn t a sfxfest like the haunting or a gorefest   this is more what i d call a supernatural drama   more interested in characters than in dazzling you with makeup    one caveat   there s a lovely twist in the movie   something like the usual suspects   where you end up replaying the movie in your head rethinking what you have just seen    i was extremely lucky to see it as a sneak preview in toronto   before any hype or critical reviews were out   so i went in with no biases    if anyone want to talk to about the movie before you see it   don t let them    let the director explain on his own pace and you ll enjoy the movie vastly more

       "17   its a stupid little movie that trys to be clever and sophisticated   yet trys a bit too hard    with the voices of woody allen   gene hackman   jennifer lopez   sylvester stallone   and sharon stone   this computer animated yak fest   think toy story  1996  filled with used merchandising   is one for the ant eaters    the main story is the independence of a worker named z   allen      he wants more to life than just digging away underground for the colony    when he finds out about   insectopia     a mythical place where all insects can run free   z   along with his colony s princess   stone     journey out into the world to find a meaning for life    about 15 minutes into the picture   i began to wonder what the point of the film was    halfway through   i still didn t have an answer    by the end credits   i just gave up and ran out    antz is a mindless mess of poor writing and even poorer voice overs    allen is nonchalant   while i would have guessed   if i hadn t seen her in the mighty and basic instinct   stone can t act   even in a cartoon    this film is one for the bugs   unfunny and extremely dull    hey   a bug s life may have a good time doing antz in

       "18   a silly film that tries to be a black comedy but plays more like lightweight comedy   with its main asset being a beautiful film location along spain s mountainous coastline    howard pigeon   jeff goldblum   is a 40 year old mineral water salesman who is married for 13 years to a wife constantly nagging him   elizabeth   mimi rogers      after a surprise birthday party for him   where his wife bawls him out for coming late to his surprise party   he confides to his best friend that he can t stand it anymore   and then tells him his plan to kill her while vacationing in the same barcelona hotel where they spent their honeymoon    jeff is going through a severe mid life crises   worried that he looks older than his age    he incessantly talks to himself   mostly agonizing over his bitter marriage and chastising himself why he went out with elizabeth for a second time   and then why he married her just because she laughed at his jokes and was attractive    he stutters and acts like a man who has lost his confidence    things change on their vacation   as elizabeth makes an effort to be nice while jeff now becomes the grouch    he nervously rehearses his murder plan in the hotel room    by accident the gun goes off and into the pillow where he imagined elizabeth would be sitting    when other hotel guests and staff come to check about the gunshot   he nervously explains that it was the tv    realizing how unworkable his plan is   he places the gun in the shattered pillow and throws it into the ocean while he waits for elizabeth    but elizabeth found his behavior odd during the entire trip   and when after a great deal of effort to get a reservation at the hotel s 5 star restaurant he insists on eating in the room   she decides she had enough of him and checks out without telling him    as a result   he goes to the police to report her missing    while with the police   a telegram comes from his wife saying she left him and is going away because she wants to be alone    his boss and all those he works with are sympathetic to him   and he gets a job promotion    but soon the pillow with the gun is fished out of the water   giving the police cause to arrest him and search his home    there they find letters he has written incriminating him to the murder    the police also find out from the hotel staff about the gunshot heard in his room    in jail   things look bad for him    no one believes him   including his friends and lawyer    his boss fires him and the papers have a field day with the headline story   pigeon   a jailbird    out on bail   he realizes that his only hope is to track down his wife    through a call placed on his credit card   he tracks her down to a mountain resort    once there he learns that she took a hike up the steep mountain and he gets a priest to be his mountain guide after telling him the true story    the film is watchable just for the antics of the jeff goldblum comic performance    he is someone coming apart by the seams   while mimi rogers is his perfect foil    it was mostly pantomine humor   with the comedy charged in the changing facial expressions of the characters and the absurdity of the situation    a very minor farce that might appeal to the sitcom crowd    the film just didn t take its situation seriously and the story had many gaps in it   so it had no chance for black humor to develop    it instead played its set up of the henpecked husband acting out his fantasy strictly for entertainment value to see how many chuckles it could draw

       "19   the rich legacy of cinema has left us with certain indelible images    the tinkling christmas tree bell in   it s a wonderful life      bogie s speech at the airport in   casablanca      little elliott s flying bicycle   silhouetted by the moon in   e   t      and now     starship troopers   director paul verhoeven adds one more image that will live in our memories forever   doogie houser doing a vulcan mind meld with a giant slug       starship troopers     loosely based on the robert heinlein novel   is the story of an interstellar war between humans and giant insects    in the hands of verhoeven   the mammoth sci fi battle flick is one of the most astonishingly bad films ever made   a monument to inept filmmaking on a colossal scale    to put it simply   it s a bug bomb    in   robocop   and   total recall     verhoeven displayed a gift for creating an entertaining mix of violence   special effects and social satire   and   starship troopers   starts off in similar fashion   with a tongue in cheek futuristic military recruitment ad that shows promise    things go downhill fast   though   as we meet our heroes   a group of buenos aires teens preparing to graduate from high school    inexplicably   johnny rico   carmen ibenez   dizzy flores and xander barcalow are played by square jawed anglo kids who look like they just stepped out of a mountain dew commercial    it s a veritable   alpha centuri 90210   as we watch the love smitten teens squabble in the name of love    michael ironside plays their teacher   who waves around a cheesy fake severed arm while lecturing about civic responsibilities    eventually   the kids join the military   with dreams of glory in their addled little minds    one of their classmates   carl jenkins     doogie houser s   neil patrick harris     snags a job in military intelligence because of his strong psychic abilities    he displays his gift by psychically ordering a pet ferret to crawl up his mother s leg    a long   dull boot camp sequence follows   enlivened only by an extended coed shower scene where the recruits swap snappy banter as the   showgirls   director s camera roams over their buff bodies    finally   a full hour into the film   the war finally starts and we meet the enemy    the bugs hail from klendathu and colonize planets by hurling their spores into space    they attack starships by spinning around and firing deadly plasma blasts from their rears    yes   incredible as it seems   the bugs actually kill with cosmic farts    a phenomenally large amount of money was spent creating the computer animated insects and the results are mixed at best    sweeping distant shots depicting hordes of giant bugs racing to attack are both impressive and scary   but the close ups are a different matter    the insects have an odd   artificial look   like origami creations with a mottled plastic coating    the attack scenes are intensely violent   as one would expect from verhoeven   but the overall look is too phony to generate any real tension    while the action is frantic   the military strategy   wildly illogical even by hollywood standards   grows tiresome quickly    verhoeven tries to spice things up by throwing in more satiric news coverage   but the faux jingoistic scenes of children   doing their part for the war effort   by squishing roaches on a sidewalk aren t enough to make up for the long stretches of sheer dreck    one can only guess what paul verhoeven was trying to do here    his customary one part satire   two parts ultra violence formula is way out of whack   and most of the film just flounders    in   showgirls   fashion   some scenes are almost bad enough to be good    an intergalactic kegger party   with jake busey playing   dixie   on a green plexiglas fiddle   has a certain bizarre appeal    a sex scene between two of the teens achieves a smarmy charm   enhanced a few minutes later when the female receives a fatal jab from a bug   but tells her hero that she doesn t mind dying       it s okay     she gasps     i got to have you      and then   of course   there s doogie s mind meld with a bug    it s possible that verhoeven was attempting to create an homage to the era of the original novel    heinlein s pre    stranger in a strange land   books were aimed at adolescent males   and   starship troopers   has the antiseptic retro future look of late 50s early 60s sci fi    the one cityscape shown is a jetsons like gleaming metropolis   with flying cars whizzing past an obvious matte painting    the hairstyles are retro too   straight from the frankie avalon   annette funicello school of fashion    ultimately   verhoeven s motives are irrelevant    he has produce a gargantuan film that fails as an action film or as a social satire    it even fails to be an entertaining bad movie    avoid   starship troopers   at all costs

       "20      the faculty     the heavily hyped and advertised sci fi horror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez   1995 s   desperado   and 1996 s   from dusk till dawn     and screenwriter kevin williamson   1996 s   scream   and 1997 s   scream 2       is being called a cross between   invasion of the body snatchers   and   the breakfast club     and i don t think i could describe it any better than that    the film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common   and then the science fiction aspect is added   involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town    the six characters   as in   the breakfast club     can be easily labeled as a stereotype   but as they are developed   they become far more complex   casey   elijah wood     the much picked upon nerd   stokely   clea duvall     a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her   zeke   josh hartnett     a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz   stan   shawn hatosy     the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics   delilah   jordanna brewster     the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist   and marybeth   laura harris     the sweet  n southern new girl in town    although the characters are only slightly connected   i   e    casey is delilah s photojournalist assistant   marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely   since they both don t have friends   etc       when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences   the only people they can count on for help is each other   even though they aren t really even sure if they can trust one another       the faculty   is another smart and pop culturally hip film from williamson   although it does not equal up to his best film   the original   scream     and rodriguez   whose   from dusk till dawn   is still one of the more original genre films of the 90 s    williamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions   respectively   that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no brainer    the plotline of   the faculty     involving aliens taking over other people s bodies   has been done quite a lot before   from   invasion of the body snatchers     to   the puppet masters     to   invaders from mars     so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh   and by setting the goings on at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens   they were mostly successful    surely   the conventions of the story are still the same   and the climax was inevitable   but there were a few surprises along the way   including the question of who were the aliens   and who weren t    the epilogue was also a refreshing change of pace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a note that probably could not have been any better    the performances in   the faculty   were a treat throughout   since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do    one exception were the teens   who   aside from elijah wood   are not very well known   but they all aquit themselves nicely   particularly wood   the seasoned pro     clea duvall   and jordanna brewster    as members of the faculty   robert patrick     t2   judgement day     was creepy as the gym coach   piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher   bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien   and salma hayek   as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold   was very funny in a small role    the standout   in my opinion   of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who   after turning into an alien   becomes the sex bombshell    if there was any problem i had with the faculty   it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence    since the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the   queen   alien   many of the faculty members disappear    it might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers   although the finale is still pretty impressive   and includes some showstopping creature effects   especially for a relatively low 15 million dollar budget    although not one of the best horror or science fiction films i have seen     the faculty   is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released    while the story is as old as the hills   it is also   in a way   timeless   because everyone   i think   has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right   as if they really weren t human    and by putting this idea in the setting of a small town high school   it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers      note   the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading   as it features r   b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters    in actuality   he only has a small role as one of stan s buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team    if i were one of the heads from dimension   i would change this advertising at once   since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving

       "21   is jimmy stewart the greatest actor of all time    it s quite possible    his career spanned over 40 years   and he acted in more movies than most actors ever could    yet   when he is talked about in the media   he is generally thought of as an actor who played one type of role   the nice guy    and that s really a shame       the naked spur   features jimmy stewart in a role completely different than what people would expect from him    it s a western   which stewart specialized in around this period   and it casts him as a desperate man out to collect a bounty on a man who used to be his friend    before he finds that man   though   he runs into two men who agree to help him   thinking he is a sheriff    when the criminal is eventually caught   the two men discover stewart s secret   and decide they want a piece of the action too    the rest of the film is a suspenseful journey in which each man suspects the other constantly    also featured is the woman travelling with the criminal   well played by janet leigh    we re never too sure who s side she s really on until the end    leigh is an actress probably best known for her role as the   shower lady   from   psycho     and that s unfair    she gives a strong performance as a woman who is pulled between these two men    stewart gives a performance unlike anything i ve ever seen from him    he usually keeps cool no matter what occurs   but here   he gets downright hysterical at times    i think perhaps he took this role to prove to the public that he was more than just a   nice guy      his performance borders on psychotic at times   but i loved watching every second of it    it s roles like this one that make me admire him as much as i do    he was an actor unafraid to take chances   and even ruin his public image

       "22   according to popular film opinion   a film s greatness is determined by time    take for example   casablanca      great film   even today    it s still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic    another example would be   star wars     which had a very   very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about 3 billion times before    but as i rewatched   independence day   when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996   i kinda felt like it wasn t as cool as when i had first seen it    i had liked it when i saw it the first time         was my original view   and basically saw it as a good   escape film      but when i rewatched it   i felt cheated    thus   the curse of the   event film         independence day   is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once   except for a couple kids   the critics   in this situation      but after a while   this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one    well   this kid is the   event film   in my little analogy    and when i rewatched   independence day     not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen   but i felt insulted the whole time    there are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just aren t sure if it s comedy or hokey drama    one scene   you ll see a hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch   the next you ll see a bunch of military uptight guys walking around   saying corny lines    the worst is a scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of   glen or glenda      now this annoying kid s problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once   he shows he has no balls    and   independence day   has no balls    it plays it safe everywhere    it throws in a ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films    the chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of   star wars      i mean   isn t that devil s den    and the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moore s breasts in   striptease      they re these octopus men   boring freaking octopus men    i mean   come on    the aliens in   2001   were more interesting and you didn t even see them    basically the plot is straight from a b movie from the 50s   aliens come to earth and we wonder if they re hostile or peaceful    okay   it s an interesting topic   but it s not handled greatly    now they aren t and somehow a computer geek   jeff goldblum   figure out they re using our satellites as a countdown to destruction    yep    these aliens are not only heavily armed   they re stupid too    they also use the same kind of computer as we do   but that comes about later    the president   bill pullman     who s under attack for being a wimp   decides this would be a nice time to be belligerent   and he decides he ll stay in the white house which the aliens have covered    i don t care if it s bob freaking dole in the white house   get him out of there    i don t care if you have to inject him with sodium pentathol   just get him out of there    later on   he s stupid and wants to fly in the attack on a big alien ship    i think it s time for impeachment for this guy    he s more senile than reagan on pot    then there s a cocky pilot   will smith   who is the only person to survive the counter attack on the second day and becomes moses in leading his children to the elusive area 51   the film s only sign of being brave      his girlfriend s a stripper sharing a subplot with   striptease   in that she has to do it for her son    come on   she has a fighter pilot boyfriend soon to be fiance    i think she can quit that job and get a more respectable job at long john silvers    she s also the few   the proud   the lucky to survive the igniting of l   a     as well as her dog   who narrowly survives      there are some bright spots    they tossed in enough old film homages to keep me laughing    the best one is when jeff goldblum   nicely named david   turns on his computer and a picture of hal comes up and says     good morning   dave      and they even played r   e   m    s     it s the end of the world as we know it   and i feel fine   at the beginning    and judd hirsch steals the film by actually acting great   he s a stereotype   but i just loved the man anyway      but there are no real subtle comic moments    will gets way too many one liners and he has no one to play off of   execept jeff towards the end   and the two do great      as i said   this film has no balls    it is just aiming for a crowd pleaser and that s what it is    but after a couple months   we all move on to the next   event   film while intaking little films and a couple indy ones for good measure    but at least the indy ones last for a lifetime    this one s short on batteries

       "23   a few months before the release of star wars episode 1   the phantom menace   20th century fox decides to release another space film   that is a complete rip off of star wars    what is the point of this    i do not know   but i wish it hadn t been done   considering wing commander is definitely the year s worst film so far    to attract people to this horrible movie   they attached the full trailer for the phantom menace    wing commander will draw large crowds   because this is the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time    the trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience i had tonight    many people do not know that wing commander is based on a star wars computer game    i found this very interesting   considering this fact almost says that wing commander is a star wars movie    it is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though    freddie prinze jr   stars in the film as christopher blair    wing commander was a huge mistake for freddie    this was definitely his worst performance to date    after january s she s all that   i actually saw a good actor in freddie   but now all those visions have been crushed       for now anyway      christopher blair is a pilot who is a part of the battle to stop the kilrathi   a group that is trying to destroy the earth    blair s parents also fought in the space battles   and also died there    his parents were pilgrims   so many people disrespect him because of this    blair is under the command of   angel     played by saffron burrows   and he is friends with another pilot   todd   maniac marshall     played by matthew lillard    matthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie   and he does in this one too    his character as stu in 1996 s scream   a      was a great one   but now   it seems like that same role is being played again   only in a space movie    the three are just a small part of a large group trying to stop the kilrathi before they take over earth    this plot is very flimsy   and doesn t give a whole lot to work with at all    this explains why wing commander drags on   seeming like there is no point to any of the events that are going on    the acting is horrible in wing commander    many lines seem out of place   and are completely meaningless    the acting and dialogue was so terrible   i even found myself laughing at it    the other things which are very bad about wing commander are the special effects and the music    the special effects are very unrealistic    when looking at two ships flying side by side   it is simple to tell they are hanging and a blue screen is behind them    the explosions look very unrealistic as well    a ship will be blown up   but there will only be fire present four about one half of a second    this is very unrealistic    music pretty much accompanies the film the entire time    the music also felt like video game music   and it was very corny and annoying sounding    after we are given the plot   the film repeats itself for another hour   without any plot twists   interesting scenes   or anything important to the film    blair is forced to make jumps over other planets   and he must also fight against the kilrathi aircraft    for the entire length of the movie   it takes place in space    it is truly like you are in a video game   because you are just watching people shoot at each other in ships for a long   extended period of time    it s not much fun to watch at all    if i wanted to watch people shoot at each other in ships   i would go watch star wars at home    at least star wars pays attention to people   myth   feelings   and has some real plot to it    the bottom line  bring on the phantom menace 20th century fox

       "24   paul verhoeven   the dutch auteur who dragged his violent   sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film   has never been what i d consider a thoughtful director   though some of his films   notably starship troopers   have been lauded as artistic achievements     but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who s managed to   no matter what the budget   make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils    starship troopers was essentially a b monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange   a great film that s nearly impossible to find on video   yet showgirls is everywhere     in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins   the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards   who may actually be 45  silicone     in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage    it s not a completely successful film   but as a failure it s certainly an interesting   and mostly entertaining   one    my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores   spetters   a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange   haven t yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight      i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop   a bleak super hero satire with a robotic hero that s as touching as schwarzenegger s in t2    that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics    its violence seemed to be there for a purpose   namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread   not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience    there s a jaw dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him    he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim s every fearful tic    it s a startling moment of barbaric   maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk noir    in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won t shut up   he impales a co worker   drowns another and so on    but why    his character is introduced as a smug genius   the kind who s always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear   sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place   though once the character becomes invisible   this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster    the kind who just won t die    hollow man s protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda   elizabeth shue   acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm   and her lover   a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who s saddled with the film s worst lines     i ve lost cohesion again          they re a typical aaron spelling couple   good looking but as vacant as george w   bush s republican national convention speech   i   e    bush referring to clinton           so much promise       but to what end    to what end         this actually got applause    suddenly warren beatty doesn t look so absurd      the rest of the film s characters are all well past thirty   though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained one liners   is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood s new character developing technique    ahh   what a cynical time we live in        as the picture opens we meet cain   kevin bacon     an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret   so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation s   project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility   for what purpose is never hinted at      they ve performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine   in a twist worthy of the film s 1950 s late show origins   to impulsively experiment on himself    caine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his co workers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead    our mad scientist is turned invisible   after several fx heavy complications     then he inexplicably   it s hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures   but this is never explored   and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human      begins raping   assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases   always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger    it grows abundantly clear with each new release that it s verhoeven s films that have become hollow    like the rest   this one is cold   heartless   and full of contempt for humanity   but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit   insight and makes no statement other than   audiences will pay for anything these days      it s an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level   or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun   thrill a minute ride    verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care    the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick    how can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self    a couple weeks ago   after seeing the trailer   a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability    hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa   in a serious manner to boot    but oh yeah   it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway    verhoeven delivers the sleazy   goods     but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner   here it just feels icky and uncomfortable    the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses   caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux psycho music strains in the background    it s plainly obvious that verhoeven isn t exploring voyeurism   like in the classic peeping tom   but exploiting it and not even doing that very well    it s funny that with all the technology  90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a woman s naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand    most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks    in fact it s largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since   by the end   most of his potential victims don infer red glasses that track his body heat    as in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov   a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre     and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked    the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy    it happens when a lab assistant   kim dickens   who looks like she stepped out of playboy   in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon   suddenly pauses       are you looking at me       she queries   obviously haunted    it s a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a plot that should have run its course by 1982   the apex of the mad slasher craze      those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you did last summer    and they re the only reason to check out hollow man   preferably as a mid week bargain rental    you ve been warned    but you probably won t listen   will you    tis  a pity

       "25   this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bont s debut as a director   1994 surprise hit speed    but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead    annie   sandra bullock   is in the wrong place at the wrong time again    she s going on a cruise with her new boy friend alex   jason patric     and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger   willem dafoe   who has a bone to pick with the shipping line    they sacked him after he got sick    now he wants the diamonds stored in the ship s safe for compensation    that actually is the whole storyline    speed 2 could do without dialogues    the movie is all about images and remarkable sound    i don t really know why this is called an action movie    except for a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies    first we are introduced to a number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie    then desaster strikes    sandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around    i looked for the   action   but couldn t find it    most of the time she is part of the decoration    the only time she is part of what happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind a fire door    now we know that she can handle a chain saw    we also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds    the bomb defusal of course goes wrong   but only the furniture is damaged   not our heroes who still are needed    jason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting with annie   helping other passengers and frolicking in the water    his initial sea sickness is suddenly gone   because there are ship   crew and passengers to be saved from evil geiger    he does a pretty good job but i can t blame keanu reeves for declining this part    then there s willem dafoe   the villain   who desperately tries to look as frightening as frankenstein s monster    he doesn t succeed   though    an untidy appearance isn t enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential    before he tries again to make us believe he is a dangerous man he should practise for a while in front of a mirror    i can t really recommend speed 2   you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that aren t meant to be funny    especially the showdown   when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then dissembles a whole village is a treat    there you get to see the most superfluous scene in the movie    in keeping with last year s desaster movie tradition a dog is miraculously saved from certain death    a really funny   and meant to be funny   scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision    some crew members watch two ships colliding in an old movie    had they looked out the window they wouldn t have missed the huge ship racing toward them    those of you who still want to see the movie should pick a theater with a large screen and a good sound system to enjoy the visual effects and the phantastic surround sound effects    in an adequately equipped theater it s as if the explosion were going off all around you and you can feel the seats vibrate    but the ilm special effects can t save the movie    for all the money they could have done better

       "26   on the basis of this film alone   i never would have predicted that   in two years   quentin tarantino would become the country s biggest hotshot director    reservoir dogs has hints of the tarantino brilliance that emerged in pulp fiction   but is a much less substantive   more conventional crime story than the big pf    here s what the two movies do have in common          scenes of intelligent   amusing dialogue with no relevance to the plot   a story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in a logical   chronological sequence   graphic yet necessary violence   an engaging crime story   dialogue liberally spiced with swear words and racial gender slurs   three of the same actors   harvey keitel   tim roth and steve buscemi     a mexican standoff ending   although this one is considerably less optimistic than pf  reservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because it s only got one story to tell rather than three    crime lord joe cabot   veteran actor lawrence tierney   has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull a diamond store heist    the five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated    instead   they are all given code names off the color chart    mr   white   keitel     mr   pink   buscemi     mr   orange   roth     mr   blonde   michael madsen     mr   brown   tarantino   and mr   peach   tarantino s chin      most of the movie s running time is spent with mr   white and pink waiting at a warehouse for the others to arrive    mr   orange   meanwhile   is on the floor   dying from a gunshot wound    the police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon   leading white to believe one of the five was an informant    the story s background unfolds through a series of flashbacks   of the crime itself and the meetings between joe and the criminals prior to the crime    eventually   blonde arrives with a police officer hostage   and what follows is a truly brutal   uncomfortable torture scene    let s just say picasso would be inspired by what blonde does to the cop s ear    a lot of the time   reservoir dogs seems like your typical gangster heist gone wrong movie   but there are a few sequences that are uniquely tarantino    the opening scene in the coffee shop starts the movie off on a high note the rest of it doesn t live up to   as the criminals plus joe have a conversation on   among other things   tipping philosophies and their interpretations of madonna s   like a virgin      another scene involves roth s lengthy manufactured story about running into a group of cops and a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana    neither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time to develop   like the captain koons gold watch speech in pulp fiction   only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie    reservoir dogs is good but it s no pulp fiction

       "27   the reunion film is not an original idea in any way   shape   or form    it s been done throughout film history over and over again   and has become one of the many sub genres   like the prep school sub genre   the angst filled teen sub genre   and the slasher sub genre    what makes   peter s friends   so remarkable is not how it doesn t follow the rules of this sub genre   but how it follows it so well   and creates characters that i wouldn t mind hanging with    what are the rules of the reunion sub genre    well          1   you need a group of friends   most of them married or at least dating   and sometimes even married or dating eachother    2   you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis    3   they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart    4   the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10    5   they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic    6   the reunion has to bring them together   seperate them with little crises   then bring them back together because   after all   they re friends    7   there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited    8   eightly   they re all unhappy or marginally so    9   there s some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that s built up over the years    10   the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts   sometimes internationally so    11   the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends   sometimes causing them to get together in dance song    since it follows these rules so closely   it will probably be   and has been   coined off as just a   british  big chill        and in some ways it is    both follow the rules   as i said   and both feature lots of bitching   big confessionals   and broken relationships    but while   the big chill   was   at least to me   a tad too whiny and unsatisfying     peter s friends   hits its mark   making this film funny   dramatic   and poignant    the friends of peter s were all in the same theatre group back in  82   performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them   the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus      after peter s   stephen fry   wealthy father   richard briers   hardly on screen enough to register   but oh well   dies   leaving a giant mansion to him   he has to decide whether or not to keep it    not sure what to do with it immeadiately   he decides to throw a giant reunion party   inviting back all his old chums    of course   all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule    andrew   kenneth branagh   also directing here   is an actor who s unhappily married to a tv star   carol   co writer rita rudner      maggie   emma thompson   is a successfuly publisher of self help books   but looks like she needs them more than her customers   as she is lonely and unhappy    roger and mary   hugh laurie and imelda staunton   who were also married in   sense and sensibility     are married   and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk   but have suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died    and sarah   alphonsia emmanuel   is as promiscuous as ever   having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian   tony slattery   who s married and wants a divorce because of her   giving her doubts    as for peter   things seem okay        the film features lots of inner friend jokes   and even some old theatre anecdotes   which i at least find a lot of fun in   as i ve done lots of theatre myself      and there are big confessions   brawls between the friends   and by the end   almost everyone is unhappy   even though some have resolved their problems long before the end   which i kinda dug      the final twist would seem forced an anti climactic   but for some reason   i felt the same way the rest of the friends did    maybe it s because the people in this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique    that s really what makes   peter s friends   so lovable   the way you just want to hang with a group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes   but when someone s in crisis   can come together wonderfully for one another    it s when you have a giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends   and these people are true friends    not to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the 80s   a decade i grew up in   unfortunately   without taking us outside of the 90s    there are some 80s classics and anti classics like tears for fears   everybody wants to rule the world     but unfortunately no stupid fun 80s songs   i think if i ever did an 80s reunion film   i d put some crap go gos song on   or at least some good old   come on eileen       but this is the british 80s we re talking about    oh well    but anyway   the direction is pretty good   although nothing amazing    branagh s forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical   but at least he s very good with making a less ambiguous film like this    the writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman   with lots of good one liners   and even some really bad but good puns   to mock the fact that andrew lives in l   a     peter   while cutting some logs   asks him is he has wood in l   a     and andrew says     no   but we have hollywood     punishment like that      the actors   as in most speaking movies   are better than their material   though   with some stand out performances to the six friends   as well as the outsiders like slattery   rudner   and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peter s mansion    a little note should be made about hugh laurie s performance   as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this   i mean   i ve never seen him actually act this dramatically       peter s friends   is a really enjoyable film which makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion   although i don t know what kind i ll have   like most people   i don t look forward to my high school reunion      because of the way these friends are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such a long period of seperation   i just look forward to the day when i can have friends like that

       "28   synopsis   the president of a company wants to test his self appointed successor   who s psychotic   and thinks it s a great idea to spend a week with him and their wives in an isolated cabin a hundred miles from civilization with no dependable transportation or means of communication after a heavy snowfall    comments   tracks of a killer had a couple of strikes against it before i even began watching it    strike one was the fact that someone had scrawled the word garbage on the videotape s sticker in black marker   not typically a good sign when you rent a film      strike two came while the previews played    did you ever get a sinking premonition about a movie s quality   or lack thereof   while watching the trailers that come before it    well   the cheesy films being advertised before tracks of a killer were films that no one has ever heard of starring people no one knows   and they all looked bad   definately not a good sign      tracks of a killer itself completed the strikeout    about the only positive thing this film had going for it was the fact that it sports some nice scenery    to be fair   the first half hour or so promises at least a watchable thriller    wolf larson   who bears more than a passing resemblance to hugh grant   adequately plays the underling obviously set up as the killer of the film s title    james brolin and kelly lebrock seem equally adequate as the loving couple larson will later threaten    brolin s character   for some inexplicable reason   thinks its a great idea to spend some time in a cabin   practically isolated   with lebrock and larson   whom he s decided to test for the week before giving him full control of his company    by the time the characters arrive at the cabin   this film begins to become tedious    apparently   brolin s successor s test involves chopping wood for the fireplace and skiing   which don t seem like attributes necessary to run a business in the city    but   then again   what do i know about business    i do think   though   that they should have invested in some better furniture for the cabin   its beds and closets have a habit of just breaking at the slightest touch    larson s character accidently kills his own wife rather than the couple he wants to kill    this leaves the movie with an hour to go and only three characters   which really isn t enough to sustain it    the film s writer must have taken a cue from stephen king   as scenes from tracks of a killer seem lifted out of misery and gerald s game    larson and lebrock fight and torture each other   the tables get turned a couple of times   while brolin tramps around in the snow looking for help    some old guy s around too   just so the killer can add to his body count without killing the couple   who everyone knows will be alive at the end of the film    the old guy   however   miraculously survives his first death and appears later to be killed again by the killer in a scene so ludicrous it s worthy of a chuckle or two    outside of that chuckle   unfortunately   tracks of a killer will just bore you as the obvious plot is drawn out ad infinitum and the actors   for some reason   become increasing obnoxious    if you re in a video store and thinking about renting this turkey   don t    make tracks to a far superior suspense film   like misery

       "29   as forgetful as some people may be it is doubtful that anyone could forget their wedding   especially three times    but   alas professor brainard somehow manages to accomplish this feat twice before the momentous night that he actually creates flubber    it s amazing that he is able to remember any of the processes he uses to make anything    the whole point here is how could a man be so blatantly forgetful    this is not absent minded this is almost mindless and he is a professor    well   this is the case for about the first half of the movie then things begin to settle into what might truly be considered absent minded    along the way to becoming absent minded from absent of mind the professor stumbles onto flubber    thankfully or there would be no movie or any amusement for the audience    the flubber is supposed to be flying rubber   but it seems to have a life of its own    this is there strictly for the kids    the properties of the flubber provide some antics for the audience when flubber coated golfballs and bowling balls assail two would be thugs    although amusing this is not original what so ever and brings back haunting memories of home alone    the poor professor has to save the university where he teaches at   get his fiancee back   finally stop the plotting of an evil millionaire   and do all this in the funniest way possible    admittedly there are funny moments but the movie is rather shallow and does not compare very well to the original   the absent minded professor      the whole scene with the basketball game was just atrocious and totally unbelievable    the basketball players   stereotypically unqualified for the sport   somehow manage to bounce   fly and dribble their way back to being close to winning    this just sounds too bad to be true   the least that could have been done was keep semi close to the original movie to give this film a chance    as for innovations and new ideas there is but two good ones in this movie    giving life to the flubber   which is so poorly executed that it s best forgotten   and prof   brainard s flying robot weebo    giving life to the flubber would have worked beautifully if it wasn t for scenes of the sort where you have the flubber dancing around on tables and books for no real reason other than to put in a bit of music and extend the length of the movie    the life of the flubber had brief and rather whimsical moments where it might have been used well   but it wasn t and in the end might have done the movie more harm than good    now   weebo is a totally different story    it s a robot that prof   brainard created but forgot how and gave something of a life too    this is a really original idea   well maybe not   but it is an idea that is well executed and in the end makes the poor robot the most developed and real character in the movie    yes folks the little yellow robot has more emotion and character than the characters    the film lacks the emotional punch to pull the audience in at all    the acting by robin williams   prof    brainard   seems to be half hearted for most of the movie and in many cases quite forced    most of the acting in the movie was so convincing as to fool only the part of the audience that had not quite yet reached the age to 12    people when stood up at the altar   don t usually give third chances    or for that matter talk to the fiancee afterwards   but what can be expected this is a children s movie    flubber   as a movie does little original and is nothing special in any respect    with the best character in the movie being something of a prop i doubt that many people will find it all that great    it does have its amusing moments and it is a good story in the end   but it does not wash up to the original    kids should find this movie amusing and fun and they ll probably enjoy the whole movie    as a movie it s just a kids movie and not the best of ones at that

       "470  many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come   the new film by visionary director vincent ward    most will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors    but little do they know   as i so plainly found out   that this has quite a complex story to tell    walking out of the theater   i could see the audience s disgust        one member even had to be awakened after the film ended    don t believe the previews that you see        this is definitely not a film for everyone    this is quite possibly one of the most adult oriented films to come out in recent years    kids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline    the plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us    it goes back and forth in time   as if it has no boundaries    think of the film city of angels    now add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision    both films deal with the afterlife   but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office    costing around  85 million to make   the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it s money back    but due to it s story   i doubt it will    for everyone who thought titanic s story was too simple and cliche   here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay   it may not have done nearly as well    but don t get me wrong        i hope the film does do well    it s a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen    i doubt most of us could have thought of this place   even in our own mind    what dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals    the only film that surpasses it is dark city    full of rich   shocking colors   we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to    but don t do that   because you ll end up going to hell    what dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake    chris   christy   nielsen   robin williams   is startled by the sudden jolt   but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat    annie   annabella sciorra   spies chris   as well   and both eventually bond and get married    annie is an artist   whose paintings are colorful   lush   and surrealistic    chris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself    they also have two children   marie   jessica brooks   and ian   josh paddock      but one day   the two children are killed in a car crash   and it almost destroys annie    she tries to commit suicide   but fails   and is then put in an institution    chris copes with the problem by realizing they aren t around anymore   and nothing will change that    just as annie gets her life back in order   chris is killed while trying to save the life of a car crash victim    chris goes to heaven   or his version of heaven   rather    guided by albert   cuba gooding   jr       chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight and joy    that is   until he realizes how miserable he is without annie    prior to heaven   he would try to comfort annie   but the more he was around   the more pain she felt    chris decides to leave her alone    little does he realize what will happen next    i m not about to say   because the plot point is crucial to the rest of the story   many critics   however   give it away      certainly   chris dying is crucial to the plot   but they tell you that he dies in the previews    story is not necessarily important for this movie to work   because it deals with the afterlife    however   strangely   virtually nothing is heard of god or the devil    a couple of comments here and there   but the story maintains its focus on chris and his search for the love of his life       we re soul mates      chris exclaims    heaven   in movies   is almost always depicted as a glowing city of white   purity   and love    usually   it also looks like it rests among the clouds    but what dreams may come goes a different route    it shows us a heaven that most of us have never seen before    chris  heaven is his memories brought to life    his thoughts can make anything real   and he makes the paintings annie drew become his heaven       i ve never seen anyone use real paint before     albert says    equally good as the depictions of hell which cast away the normal stereotypes of fire and brimstone    instead   it s a state of being    in one gloriously horrific scene   chris and his   tracker     max von sydow   arrive at a sea of faces    thousands of heads are stuck above ground   their bodies somewhere else    mostly dead silent   some quips are made   almost as if to lighten the mood    it s truly a frightening sequence    production designer eugenio zanetti is definitely going to be up for an oscar nomination    using state of the art computer technology   worlds are created for exploration    sometimes   some scenes play out as if they are only there for the visual impact    it s not necessary to be there   but we appreciate seeing it    costume designer yvonne blake   who also appears in the film   has done an incredible job providing some interesting and colorful costumes    cinematographer eduardo serra   whose work was last seen in the luscious wings of the dove   has a difficult job   as most cinematographers do working with special effects    but serra s entire universe is a computer generated image   and he does a masterful job    writer ron bass   adapting from the novel by richard matheson   provides a very fluid screenplay with no real set plot    the story is extremely vague in its details   allowing viewers to think for themselves about the meaning    and director vincent ward puts it all together into his final vision    what dreams may come is a good example of german expressionism which may just turn off a good portion of the audience    your average movie goer more than likely isn t used to expressionistic techniques    the film will also definitely draw attention from religious people   but they shouldn t take it too far    it is   after all   just a movie    robin williams has continuously impressed with his dramatic performances   while his comedic roles have been suffering    his comedy is perfection when he makes up his own stuff   but when is confined by a screenplay   he isn t quite as effective    but drama is really his strong point   and you can see that here    it s doubtful he ll get another oscar nomination   but i wouldn t really mind if he did    the real surprise here is annabella sciorra who impressed last year with cop land    this may be her breakout role and may garner her some much needed attention    it s also quite possible that she could get an oscar nomination    however   the academy doesn t like to award performances for these types of films    cuba gooding   jr   has been better   but he s certainly not distracting    max von sydow is underused   as are jessica brooks and josh paddock    a treat for some movie goers is to see werner herzog appear   if they even recognize him   as chris  father lost in the sea of faces    it s not hard to see why herzog would be attracted to this film   considering he thinks that audiences are starving for great images    overall   it s williams and sciorra s film    what dreams may come is rated pg 13 for thematic elements involving death   some disturbing images   language   and some partial nudity    the film is definitely aimed at a more adult audience    some will find the plot distracting    some will find the visuals absolutely glorious    and some will find both    the only real problem with the film   that i could see   was that it slows down considerably during the midsection   just after we have been immersed in the visuals and before the search for annie begins    by the way   some controversy even surrounded the title   which was mistaken for a sexual term     what   becomes   wet   and you should understand      in actuality   the title is from a soliloquy in hamlet    just thought i should let you know

pennsylvania community   the deer hunter promises to be one of those movies that you will never forget    in this academy award winner for best picture of 1978   outstanding performances are turned in by all actors   and cimino s brilliant directing provides the perfect vision into the character s lives    the first act of the film provides us with an inside look into the lives of a group of men from a small community who work and hang out together    michael   portrayed perfectly by robert de niro   is shown early on as the natural leader of the group    after a days work   the men leave their jobs at a factory to head down to the local bar   where john   george dzundza   works    three of the men   michael   steven   john savage     and nick   christopher walken   will be leaving shortly for vietnam   but not before steven gets married    after the marriage   the group   including axel   chuck aspegren     spend one last day on a hunting trip   one of their favorite past times    this sequence of events enables us to view the lifestyle of a normal group of men   who will be suddenly and permanently affected by the ravages and separations of war    the wedding scenes   although criticized by many as being quite long   actually enhance even more the purpose of the first act    the outstanding performances by de niro   walken   streep   savage   and cazale   who died very shortly after the filming of the movie was completed   really begin to shine through and promise not to halt in the near future    the second act of the movie begins with the trio of men on the front lines in vietnam   stationed in a south vietnamese village being attacked by the viet cong    the men are eventually captured and held in a floating prison on a river    this prison   run by the v   c      initiates the horrifying scenes in the movie   where the prisoners are forced to play russian roulette against each other    steven   who is emotionally marred by this turn of events   is secluded in a tiger cage with water up to his face when he refuses to participate    michael shows his leadership again by convincing nick that the only way that steven will survive is if the two friends play against each other   and moreover   they must play with 3 bullets in the gun    personally   i felt that de niro s absolutely gripping portrayal really was displayed in a brilliant way in these and the following scenes    the men are eventually able to escape   but are separated    michael is able to get steven   who ends up losing his legs   to medical care   while nick finds his way to saigon and a u   s   army hospital    michael returns home and does not feel at all like a hero    he wants to avoid the celebrations and recognition that his friends would like to bestow upon him    he assumes that nick is still lost in vietnam    the third act concentrates more on walken s character   who eventually stumbles upon a small gambling operation where the game is   again   russian roulette    only in this game   you play for money    michael has learned that nick is possibly still alive and returns to saigon to attempt to find him    the two narrowly find each other at the russian roulette games   but do not link up until michael discovers nick participating in the games and tries to bring him home    a very emotional   and   for many   a very disturbing movie   the

       "472  note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    like its own opening shot   from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity   persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent    a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry   boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking    the film follows a soft spoken young man   eddie adams   mark wahlberg   from torrance   through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom   and later   to a harrowingly precipitous drop    as boogie nights opens   he s toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub   and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity    recruited by fatherly jack horner   a rejuvenated burt reynolds     a successful porn filmmaker   eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler   pornstar    wholeheartedly embraced by jack s troupe   including the maternal amber waves   julianne moore     reed rothchild   john c   reilly     buck swope   don cheadle     rollergirl   heather graham     dirk and his   one special thing   are quickly propelled to the top of his field   fulfilling his mantra of being a   big bright shining star      his lack of discipline   however   incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in    the element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr   anderson   whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious    from the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool   mr   anderson s accomplished command of the camera is without question    while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating   impertinent and self congratulatory   case in point   marc rocco s unforgettable perpetual motion helming of murder in the first     in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr   anderson   be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp   is purposeful and potent    it s a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker s career    boogie nights is only his second feature film   following up his debut feature from earlier this year   hard eight    and although it s somewhat derivative   his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman   while in terms of visuals he s clearly influenced by martin scorsese     at least he s borrowing from some of the best   and it s entirely effective within the context of this film    while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective   in terms of sheer entertainment value it s also rollicking good fun   with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour    the film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music   clothes   hairstyles   dance   idioms   and culture   aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges   and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent   pre aids scare period in american history where uninhibited   free wheeling lifestyles abounded    while much of the film s humour pertains to the characters  obliviousness of now outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society    a prime example is part time salesman buck swope s demo of a stereo system with an eight track tape   and inviting a prospective customer to get  freaky deaky  with the music    it s elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule   but of wistful reminiscence   and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous    a giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny   to be sure   but oddly magical   and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie dirk s bedroom   completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures   farrah fawcett   cheryl tiegs   bruce lee   is breathtaking    ably supported by a well selected collection of period music   all of which purportedly came straight from mr   anderson s personal collection     there s a clear affection for the era in boogie nights    it s the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline   the film s promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters    after the debacle with 1996 s milos forman film   the people vs    larry flynt   another finely crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography related storyline   the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public    however   while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago   it s hardly a lurid or seamy film    given the subject matter   there s very little nudity   and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous    and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality   but simply as a business    the glimpses on the sets of jack horner s shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate   there s a candid matter of factness in terms of sex   his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job   and it s refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking   such as coercion or debauchery   are avoided    if anything   boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves    jack horner s dream is an honourable one    he genuinely aspires to make a great film    and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood   albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence      in both films   the world of quickie low budget filmmaking is explored   and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton   scott alexander   and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets    jack s retort of   there are shadows in light   baby   to his cinematographer s complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood s   it s not about the little details   it s about the big picture      rant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false    in boogie nights and ed wood   the aspirations of the respective filmmakers  prove to be bemusing   not in their intentions    there s nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an  artistic  erotic picture    but in the degree that they miss the mark    much like the humour lacing ed wood   the laughs involving jack horner are double edged   after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres   when jack breathes   this is the best work i ve ever done     it s genuinely funny   but given his utter sincerity   also possesses a tinge of sadness    mr   anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter    while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging   there really isn t any clever dialogue in the film   though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film s characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges   when one considers that the film s   protagonist   literally doesn t say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time   it s no wonder why the playfully inane   how much can you bench      banter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film s finest exchanges    and while mr   anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters   it s problematic that some of the the threads given to the film s characters are simply stale material    julianne moore s child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff   better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv movie version of her character s story   and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions    still   even if he doesn t always know what to do with his characters   mr   anderson most definitely captures their essences   and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious    misguided   even aimless   hopelessly naive   self destructive   insufferable   i loved them just the same    in any case   it s hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired   and ultimately best executed   scenes of the year   a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson   a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance   even if it s a small one   in a suicidal drug deal scam   only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric   the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger s   sister christian   on his stereo system is sheer brilliance   flanked by an armed bodyguard    if this scene already wasn t tense enough with these elements   mr   anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene   who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room   pushing the scene to a new   surreal level of delightful giddiness    there are some other interesting touches in boogie nights    mr   anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight   here   it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect    similarly   a painful scene where crew member scotty j   philip seymour hoffman   breaks down in tears in the driver s seat   sobbing   i m so stupid   after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver s seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening    boogie nights is exceedingly well cast   and each of the actors rise to the occasion   the ensemble cast is uniformly good    while most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr   wahlberg   fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films   and mr   reynolds   terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film   ringing true in every respect     a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention    mr   reilly demonstrates here   as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbard s georgia   a genuine aptitude for comedy    many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film    i m not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot   but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee    mr   reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number   and it s wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation    worth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad   and dead on period   it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me   demo track   you got the touch   in a vain attempt at a musical career    mr   reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective    ms   graham   with her long dirty blonde hair   innocent demeanour   and huge hazel eyes   looks like a disney animated heroine come to life    or in this case   a disney animated heroine who came to life   made a wrong turn   and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late 70s   early 80s adult film industry    consequently   it s a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweet faced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates   but in a scene where she s lounging in a limousine prowling the streets   garish red lipstick messily smeared on   giving the camera a hilariously pouty come hither look   all one can do is gulp    her role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out   err    in a figurative sense      she s essentially a glorified extra    but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity       if only mr   anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face   though      and a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish   as a teen   ms   graham s parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers   since then   her most notable roles have been as a junkie   gus van sant s drugstore cowboy   and now a porn starlet    draw your own conclusions    perhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr   cheadle   who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity   and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion    his relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st   vincent   an interesting melora walters   is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness   and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible   it s no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry    while the scenario is familiar   the wounded look in cheadle s eyes makes the scene unforgettable    luis guzman s most famous work is possibly in brian de palma s carlito s way   and here he plays a variation on the same character   maurice t   rodriguez is a hapless but good natured nightclub owner who s a hanger on to jack s group   ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack   with little disguise made of his desperation   for a part in one of his erotic pictures    jack s eventual acquiescence to maurice s request leads to one of boogie nights  biggest comic payoffs    boogie nights is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr   anderson   who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of note with this work    striking a fine balance between humour and drama   and exceptionally well crafted   there s no doubt that boogie nights is among the very best films of the year      \n",
       "473  steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few years back   he spent this time writing essays and short stories for   the new yorker     several of which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation   pure drivel   1998      much of the book spares tinseltown from mockery   although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview   in a fine chapter called   in search of the wily filipino      now   as writer and star of bowfinger   he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a career in the cinema   perhaps finally venting the frustrations    everything being made now is crap    that led to his brief retirement from hollywood    martin stars as bobby bowfinger   a roger corman wannabe on the cusp of fifty and desperate for some success as a producer   quality of the projects be damned    his accountant   adam alexi malle   proposes a movie called   chubby rain     about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops    bowfinger latches onto the idea immediately   and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film   based on the lie that america s top box office draw   kit ramsey   murphy     has agreed to star    ramsey   of course   wants nothing to do with such low grade material   so bowfinger   on the thinking that action stars need to run   not speak   decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously    he sends his cast members   who aren t in on it   either   they are told ramsey hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his co stars   to ramsey s table at restaurants   asks them to follow him in parking lots   etc     spouting script dialogue   all the while shooting the outcome from a great distance    the paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time    ramsey is a member of mind head   a cultish self help organization apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities       as if that s not familiar enough   mind head guru terry stricter   terence stamp   has been dressed and combed to resemble l   ron hubbard   founder of scientology      when he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble   white code   in his face   they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him off to a retreat   requiring bowfinger to find a stand in    murphy will probably win more fans as jiff   ramsey s adorable   ignoramus double   than as kit   but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage    always surrounded by an entourage   suffering from a racial inferiority complex   murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself    furthermore   consider the enemies he ll make of popular scientologists    pacing stricter s neutral coloured office as if on an amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer   ramsey is asked to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly    murphy s scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine of a john travolta   clearing      not that murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick   bowfinger is steve martin s invention    his script is surprisingly clever as satire   given that the pseudo religion is a sitting duck   as is the entire los angeles film industry       the griffin mill types take quite a beating   in the form of robert downey jr   as bigwig jerry renfro      martin s decision to tell the story from a bottom feeder s point of view is what keeps it fresh and innovative never have we seen on screen a group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture    as expected   there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs   such as martin s crew of mexican border jumpers   who gain unexpected appreciation for the classics from reading   cahiers du cinema     or martin s nonsensical explanation to dave   his loyal cinematographer   jamie kennedy     that every movie   in the end   has a budget of two thousand dollars          most of bowfinger is universally funny   however   i defy any viewer to keep a straight face when christine baranski   one of our brightest comediennes   is on screen    bowfinger s main flaw is a

blush       this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in oz s last directorial effort   the poorly conceived in   out      these are significant enough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece    as i mentioned at the start of this review   bowfinger offers solid reasons not to do what heather graham s character daisy does   hop a bus to hollywood in search of stardom    that said   it offers one fantastic reason to get on that bus   the sense of community between filmmakers who gel is awesome    martin gets sentimental by story s end as he did in l   a   story   and how could he not    for those who can hack it   the movies might be the greatest business in the world

       "474  films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success   whether they re about superheroes   batman   superman   spawn     or geared toward kids   casper   or the arthouse crowd   ghost world     but there s never really been a comic book like from hell before    for starters   it was created by alan moore   and eddie campbell     who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid  80s with a 12 part series called the watchmen    to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd    the book   or   graphic novel     if you will   is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes    in other words   don t dismiss this film because of its source    if you can get past the whole comic book thing   you might find another stumbling block in from hell s directors   albert and allen hughes    getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in   well   anything   but riddle me this   who better to direct a film that s set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society    the ghetto in question is   of course   whitechapel in 1888 london s east end    it s a filthy   sooty place where the whores   called   unfortunates     are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision    when the first stiff turns up   copper peter godley   robbie coltrane   the world is not enough   calls in inspector frederick abberline   johnny depp   blow   to crack the case    abberline   a widower   has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium    upon arriving in whitechapel   he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly   heather graham   say it isn t so   and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can t stomach    i don t think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper   so i won t go into the particulars here   other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay    in the comic   they don t bother cloaking the identity of the ripper   but screenwriters terry hayes   vertical limit   and rafael yglesias   les mis   rables   do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end    it s funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because   after all   an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts    and from hell s ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days     who holds back the electric car who made steve guttenberg a star          don t worry   it ll all make sense when you see it    now onto from hell s appearance   it s certainly dark and bleak enough   and it s surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did   at times   it seems like sleepy hollow 2      the print i saw wasn t completely finished   both color and music had not been finalized   so no comments about marilyn manson     but cinematographer peter deming   don t say a word   ably captures the dreariness of victorian era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks   even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black and white comic    oscar winner martin childs    shakespeare in love   production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place    even the acting in from hell is solid   with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent    ians holm   joe gould s secret   and richardson   102 dalmatians   log in great supporting roles   but the big surprise here is graham    i cringed the first time she opened her mouth   imagining her attempt at an irish accent   but it actually wasn t half bad    the film   however   is all good    2   00   r

       "475  the party is one of those classic slapstick comedies that will leave you   at times   cracking up    the film takes place   for the most part   in real time during an exclusive evening party that is attended only by the biggest names in hollywood    hrundi v   bakshi   played very well by peter sellers   is a struggling actor who just came to america from his homeland   india    hrundi tries out his acting talents   but it seems that he just isn t cut out for the job    on the set of his current film that he stars in   hrundi seems to make everything go for the worse    during the filming of this movie set in the 1800 s   hrundi manages to annoy the director   herbert ellis   in any way he can    this includes a pitiful acting job in many scenes   wearing an underwater watch in one scene   and accidentally detonating a massive set    many of the hollywood producers and big names want hrundi out of the business forever    and when the director makes a personal phone call to mr   clutterbuck   j    edward mckinley   pleading for hrundi s ejection from hollywood   everything is pretty much over for hrundi    clutterbuck writes his name down on a piece of paper to insure that hrundi will never again work in hollywood    but when this piece of paper turns out to be the guest list for clutterbuck s exclusive party   hrundi is invited   and certain chaos is bound to occur    of course   as predicted   hrundi causes lots of trouble    each scene in which hrundi encounters a situation   usually one that he can t handle   is almost always very humorous    and each scene with hrundi and the drunken waiter   who is alone hilarious   adds to the comedy in a great way    the party can be compared to many other films of it s type   specifically the trio of naked gun movies and the airplane movies   but the party is a delightful movie that incorporates very well played out comedy into believable situations    it also includes a number of memorable scenes   can anyone say   birdy num num          if you re in the mood for fun and enjoyable slapstick comedy   check out the party    it s not going to be one of your all time favorites   but if you enjoy this type of humor   you ll enjoy the party

       "476  on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements   in case you missed it   warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail    he says to a black congregation         if you can t cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife   you re never gonna get rid of me        well   there is such a plot   and it works very well in this comedy    beatty plays jay billington bulworth   a long time democratic senator from california    the movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworth s latest commercials condemning affirmative action    the montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy    when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv   having gone without food or sleep for days    his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care    first he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe   a  10 million life insurance policy in his daughter s name    then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination    his assistant murphy   oliver platt   is oblivious to bulworth s suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements    bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african american church   then takes questions from the audience    he is hit hard with questions about his voting record    he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots   and it hasn t shown up    since he s a dead man anyway   he figures he ll answer truthfully   he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l   a   for the photo opportunity    they made some promises that improved their public image for a while   and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made    the shock and outrage from the congregation grows   the questions keep coming   and he keeps shooting back honest   if ugly   answers       before i go further   i d like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make   and that is that characterizing african americans as malt liquor drinking o   j    fans is not part of bulworth s   truth      that line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie    when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics   this line is not what they re talking about      the experience is liberating    with nothing left to lose   bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth    he can say whatever he wants because he s going to be dead anyway    why not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician   that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists   and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism    bulworth s candor wins him three volunteers from the church   one of whom   nikki   halle barry     he gets a crush on    he feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something    chicken wings   appropriately enough    bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives    when one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings   bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment    with so much money and so many talented people working so hard   he wonders   why can t hollywood make a quality product       you go   warren      when they become indignant and ask why he s talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product   he callously admits that it s because they are rich jews    that night he drops the three african american volunteers at their nightclub   and he decides to go in with them    he stays up all night drinking   smoking pot   dancing   falling in love with nikki   and learning to scratch turntables and rap    the next day   he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suit and tie fundraisers    from then on   at all of his political appearances   he raps his political truth    his rap is not bad for a middle aged white guy    he s not very good   but it is his first try and at least he s not embarrassingly bad    his lobbyists are not amused   but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth    eventually   the movie s plot   remember he hired a hit man      overtakes the politics   which is too bad    screen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him    there are even a few gratuitous chase scenes   bulworth fleeing his killer    these scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along   but it distracted and detracted from bulworth s political ranting   which was much more interesting than the ever present   obvious looking assassin    still   most of the movie is original and very enjoyable   and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen    as the story and screen writer   he came up first with a good structure   then with good dialogue to back it up   jeremy pikser co wrote the screenplay      as an actor   he was able to convincingly portray bulworth s depression   then liberation and rebirth    as a producer   there were four others   he was able to keep the movie free from hollywood s indulgent formulas   except for those inexcusable chase scenes      someone else probably could have directed   but since he was there anyway   what the heck    it s too bad that there aren t more movies like this around   movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics    after all   much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news    just a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants    just don t expect to be popular with the insurance companies

       "478  capsule   the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith s films gets their own movie    the gags are sporadically funny    it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti gay jokes    the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team    the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film    sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching    this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night       and it turns out he had very good reasons         low 0    4 to  4    a film needs a plot    it needs characters for empathy value    it needs a story and an emotional center    if a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are    kevin smith has now made two satisfying films   clerks and chasing amy    with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp    peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled    but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith s fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it    his remaining two films   mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience    jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes   penis jokes   flatulence jokes   film pastiches   and in jokes    how funny the jokes are will be a subjective call    for me   the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny    there was not enough cleverness or variety    it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay    penis jokes work only so many times    showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags    they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford   the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post war films including dead of night   the lady vanishes   and passport to pimlico    jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners    as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts    in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads    jay and silent bob   played by jason mewes and kevin smith   are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks    this leaves them at loose ends    they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie    they decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash    so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way    the film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood  the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny    silent bob   being silent   can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his    this makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have    jay has to be the comic    he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive    the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny    he is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair    so jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team    their starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before  sometimes just minutes before    like dogma before it   but definitely not like chasing amy   this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie    certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving    they are excuses for gags   many of which still fall flat    it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content    the film does not offer much to an adult audience    i rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the  4 to  4 scale

       "479  this was the last carry on movie   if you discount  carry on columbus  as a carry on movie   and was made by a new production company    based in central london   this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert   suzanne danielle   to bed her husband emile the french ambassador   kenneth williams      when he seems unwilling   she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes   such as the prime minister and the u   s   ambassador    her antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages    she is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead    meanwhile   theodore valentine   larry dann   is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her    however   she is only interested in restoring her husband s ardour which seems a little difficult after emile s accident with a church spire    this film is the second worst carry on movie   the worst being  carry on england     it is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written    newcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid   as mrs   valentine   are mildly funny   but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad    kenneth williams only appears in a few scenes and his lacklustre performance is warranted   given the script    the small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler   joan sims as mrs   dangle   kenneth connor as leyland the chauffeur   and peter butterworth as richmond   are worthless and embarassing    in fact   all four parts are surplus to requirements    however   the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades    an awful script   a terrible collection of jokes   very poor production values   especially the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st   james palace     a ludicrous and cringeworthy musical score   and a non existent plot or storyline    its just a succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle will bed next    jack douglas is not so annoying but is more boring   joan sims and peter butterworth are wasted   and kenneth connor and kenneth williams put in some poor performances as leyland and emile    a complete waste of time   this movie was trying to catch up with the new sexually permissive seventies    it was a certificate 15 film but by 1978   there was little interest in this kind of film and it flopped at the box office and was only given its premiere on uk terrestrial television in april 1998    avoid at all costs

       "480  for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo   the killer   hard boiled   face off   appears to have made an exciting   elegant   charming spy thriller   kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american   read   unsophisticated   hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them    sadly   as the picture progresses   the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up   two hour long episode of magyuver    and not a particularly good one at that    what went wrong    mi2 begins flashily enough   that initial flash leading us to believe that it ll soon give way to something of a plot   but it only gives way to more flash   then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise s firing gun just so they can die really cool    early on   during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt   tom cruise   and nyah nordoff hall   thandie newton     woo works some of his trademark magic    in one hypnotic   though completely inexplicable sequence   the director slows the action down to a languid semi stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other s eyes with come hither sexuality       just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance   coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff    prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain   sans scaffolding   then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another    why    i haven t the foggiest    i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply    with mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine   the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects    it s possible that these   spies   could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off   though of course this is never explored    the scenes i ve described are really only included to titillate   not to give any insight into character    god forbid    woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic   but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial like visuals    still in terms of crackerjack eye candy   the opening has much to cherish    cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices   the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is      between the frantic dancing   woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact    the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way   yet it has style and something of soul   and woo casts a bit of a spell on us    sure it s all smoke and mirrors   but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product    thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that s about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez   george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight    they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres    newton bats her eyes flirtatiously    cruise grins a little too slyly    the cruise character   ethan hunt   has been drastically altered since the first film    here cruise plays him more as a hip   sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1    he s cool and dashing   which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut   which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film     and blustered his way through magnolia   quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90 s      sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise s initial   i m the man      charm and more slo mo close ups of his preening mug    mi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act   which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won t stop    the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle   the first gun fight in the film     which really should be unheard of in a john woo film   but alas this particular battle could ve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi   of course excepting the   symbolic   pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture      we ve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand    it isn t done any differently here    the action is pure hard target   broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind    he s cool for sure but he s made to be as empty as the movie    the actor isn t used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks   he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment   be it during a gunfight   before one or after one    when he s not beaming away   he s staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell   but woo s editing seriously undermines the effort    he fetishizes cruise s angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof    i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he s really austin powers    in a classic woo action moment   ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin up boy angel of death    the gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual   one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise   basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does      the lead bad guy   played by the appropriately british dougray scott   and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken       on motorcycles    though instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment   the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug   only to fly about a hundred feet   still in bear hug position     land on a beach below and begin a mano e mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a   so you thought i was dead            not to worry   cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat    what a hero    you may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2 s plot    my reasoning is simple   i m not sure of any good it would do    the film itself has absolutely no concern with story   only with hurtling forth to the next   special   effect    i wasn t kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video    nobody will go to this for the plot   and if they do they ll surely regret it    as summer movies evolve   or devolve   character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing    in mi   the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma s   that film s director   stylistic flourishes   while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo s non stop masturbatory pandemonium    it s irrelevant in every sense   as is character    all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors

       "481  hollywood has a   750  batting average with elmore leonard adaptations    last year s touch was ill conceived and just plain odd but get shorty   jackie brown and now out of sight all were highly entertaining movies    steven soderburgh   master of sex   lies and videotape   now adds crime to his repertoire in this tale of bank robbery   prison   double crossing   uncut diamonds and   oh yeah   true love    george clooney is the protagonist   a risky choice after such duds as batman and robin and the peacemaker   but for once i didn t want to slap the taste out of his mouth    he plays his role in out of sight as the suave cary grant type perfected in hitchcock movies   the kind of guy to whom crime is just a profession like any other    nowhere present is clooney s usual ain t i sexy sneer    there s just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit in with the leonard style    clooney is definitely a perfect successor to john travolta in get shorty    clooney plays a man who s robbed about 200 banks without ever using a gun    in the opening scene   he walks into one bank and robs it not only with ease but with charm    of course   he gets caught   so it s not all good    it s while doing time in a florida prison that clooney learns of one rich inmate s   albert brooks in a frightful bald wig   collection of diamonds in detroit    clooney and cohort ving rhames plan the score   while protection artist and fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans    meanwhile   there s jennifer lopez    unintentionally funny in selena and intentionally funny in anaconda   she s finally graduated to a worthy role as the u   s   marshal who happens to be driving up to the jail on the night clooney escapes    rhames is waiting to give him a ride in a stolen car   and lopez makes it a threesome   her hostage ass locked in a trunk with clooney    he s covered in dirt and has a gun to her neck   and it s a little cramped in there   but they manage to make a love connection anyway   probably because it s a movie    the relationship between clooney and lopez is at the heart of the movie   and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noir ish crime story    the leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than crime   and this is no exception    although they re not really germane to the plot   lopez s relationship with her father   dennis farina of get shorty     rhames  relationship with his christian sister   you could call her sister christian   and a pop in cameo by michael keaton all lend extra class to a movie already full of it    out of sight spans at least three years but has a non linear structure   focusing on the jailbreak   brooks score and flashing back to earlier times    this is a movie with a brain   as smooth and calculated as the clooney and lopez characters themselves    the entire cast does the material justice    clooney and lopez coming into their own   and rhames and cheadle cementing their positions as two of my favorites    here s hoping future leonard adaptations continue to carry the torch    serving america for almost 1 20th of a century

       "482     mandingo   has traditionally been seen as one of two things   either a much needed revisionist look at slavery in the south   or in the words of film critic leonard maltin     a trashy potboiler   that   appeals only to the s m crowd      actually   i think   mandingo   is a strange combination of the two   although it fails on both fronts    it s too trashy to be good drama   but too dramatic to be good trash    the story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell   james mason   and his son   hammond   perry king      one day in new orleans   hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede   heavyweight boxer ken norton      although the movie never explains it   a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley    according to the movie   mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves    hammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him    hammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves    meanwhile   hammond has married his cousin   blanche   susan george     because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild    hammond   however   is happier spending nights with his   bed wench     the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex    it is quickly apparent that hammond   despite his overt racism   is more in love with his bed wench   a sensitive slave girl named ellen   brenda sykes     than he is with blanche    hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had   pleasured   her before he did    of course   it s fine that he s slept with numerous slave girls   but the fact that his wife   a   white lady     had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her    so blanche is usually left lonely and sex starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen    blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child    hammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half black child   although it s okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond     so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth   and hammond poisons blanche    hammond then finds mede   shoots him twice in the shoulder   and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water    yes   you read right   the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive    judging only by the plot     mandingo   is pure sexploitation    the main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible   with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society    when   mandingo   was released in 1975   it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail   this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs    dramatically     mandingo   is weak and unfocused   and historically it s mostly confused    if one were to judge history by this film   it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality   not economics    not once in the film do we see any of the slaves working   except for a few house servants    the men spend most of the time sitting around   while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner    there is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves   but   mandingo s   overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick   although there s plenty of violence    fights   vicious beatings   shootings   and the aforementioned human boiling sequence    thrown in for good measure      some tried to write off   mandingo   as a blaxploitation film   one of a number of quickly made   low budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies   but it s not that easy       mandingo   was studio financed by paramount pictures   and produced by dino de laurentiis   the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as   the bible     1966     the remake of   king kong     1976     and the ill fated   dune     1984      the director was richard fleischer   a veteran who was best known for several special effects laden action movies including   20   000 leagues under the sea     1954   and   fantastic voyage     1966     as well as such superior suspense films as   the narrow margin     1952      the script   based on the supermarket best seller by ken ostott   and the subsequent play by jack kirkland     was penned by norman wexler   who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on   serpico      james mason   perry king   and susan george were well known and respected actors   mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt     and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career    so why is   mandingo   so bad    a number of reasons   including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job    wexler s script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive   it combines stereotyped slave talk     yessuh   massuh       stereotyped southern white trash talk     fer whut re you gittin  outta bed         and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk     if you see me hang   you gonna know you killed a black brother          fleischer s direction is clumsy   especially during the fight scenes   and all the actors give weak performances   especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable    nevertheless   credit should be given where credit is due    despite its exploitative nature     mandingo   was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery    until then   there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery    even classics such as   gone with the wind     1939   can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter       mandingo   reassessed the south   and showed that it wasn t all beautiful plantations   green fields   and pretty sunsets    but all this is constantly undermined by the film s negligible point of view    it claims to see things from the black perspective   but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners    with a little more maturity and different handling     mandingo   might have been an effective   worthwhile film    while it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery   it never deals with them    the issues the movie brings up are worthwhile   but wexler s script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing    there is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner   but   mandingo   never does it    steven spielberg touched on that same topic in   schindler s list     1993     by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid    the difference between that film and   mandingo   is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair   unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma       mandingo   is satisfied to simply show some skin   and because of that   its   trashy potboiler   nature

       "483  i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory    this was   of course   a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this    not only did i get to see an advance screening   i was able to see an advance screening of a   very good   movie    the very fast paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher   a fast talking   witty   comical taxi driver in new york city    gibson s performance is terrific   and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films    gibson again teams up with richard donner   as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick   and this time around   the combination works even better    the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique    try to imagine a toned downed version of travis bickle who   this time around   is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover ups    if you can imagine that   then you ve basically got jerry fletcher    in many ways   i was surprised by this movie    to begin with   i was surprised at how good it was    don t get me wrong   it s not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring   but it was a very enjoyable movie    secondly   i was surprised at mel gibson s performance    he provided a fantastic performance    the previews of this film led me to believe it was an all out action flick   which after viewing   it was almost the opposite in a certain sense    gibson s character has an almost uncountable number of one liners   hilarious situations   and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film    for instance   jerry s apartment   and especially his security   is memorable    and last   i was surprised at how good the plot is    writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story   and when watching this film   you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher s far fetched   or so they seem at first   conspiracy theories are helgeland s own opinions    mel gibson isn t the only stand out in the film    julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton   the department of justice employee who can t seem to stay away from jerry fletcher   who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories    he also seems obsessed and in love with her    but whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories   she shrugs him and his beliefs off   continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him    jerry   obviously determined to continually seek out the truth   continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory   which will be printed in his newsletter   same title as the movie

       "484  the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summer s other comic book adaptation   batman and robin    both films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts   but also their monosyllabic dialogue and empty headed character motivations    in panel sized morsels   implausible plots and   rambo    esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork   but on thirty foot silver screens   it s much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures    spawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons   white   who is framed by a corporate baddie   played without irony by sheen     then set on fire and left for dead    though the movie skimps on the next few plot points   here s what i could determine   said assassin then becomes the leader of satan s army   under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown   leguizamo   grating as always      he is renamed   for reasons unbeknownst   spawn   and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon    but when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child   he realizes that he can t be the evil superdemon he s expected to be   and he sets about avenging his untimely death    typical of summer blockbusters   spawn is an effects laden ninety minute rock video    while the visions of hell are laughably crude   think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man     spawn s prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold    but the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion   spawn longs for his wife   but they don t have a single scene together before simmons  death       conflict   who will triumph is not anybody s guess     and believability   not that i expected it      so many questions are left unanswered   and i m sure they won t be addressed in the inevitable sequel    while last year s the crow   city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative   which was lazy and somewhat incoherent     it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power    spawn is an in your face   screaming banshee of a film   these guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid   but they haven t the faintest idea how to make a movie

her words   however   appear to fall on deaf ears as reese turns up drunk at the family homestead later that evening   urging beau to join him in the boathouse    there are words and advances and some pushing and shoving and beau runs back into the house   passed his startled mother   as the crack of a wooden railing giving way breaks the cold blue silence and an intoxicated reese tumbles out of

based on elisabeth sanxay holding s novel   the blank wall       the deep end   is a well crafted thriller written and directed by scott mcgehee and david siegel     suture        it makes the most of a talented but not particularly well known cast  goran visnjic plays alek with a suave likeability   jonathan tucker shines as the conflicted beau   peter donat is amusing as grandfather hall   and josh lucas has an equally small but effective role as the hapless darby reese    the film is also lovingly photographed by giles nuttgens and features an evocative score   courtesy peter nashel    but it owes everything to british actress tilda swinton    swinton   whose pale faced ethereal beauty has graced many of derek jarman s films     caravaggio       edward ii       the last of england       plays margaret hall in   the deep end   and   like charlotte rampling in this year s   under the sand     turns in a commanding and accomplished performance    margaret is a devoted mother who is willing to risk everything to protect the ones she loves   and swinton captures every frustration   every fear   every subtle examination and every fervent realization and every nervous oscillation of her being    the role calls for an extremely wide range of emotions none the least of which is simply playing a mother beset with a multitude of domestic responsibilities    many can relate to that   of course   it s the murder cover up and the blackmail and the fear of losing one s son that swinton so gracefully   so graciously   makes resonate with the truest of colors    the end is deep all right   and there isn t a single shallow moment in tilda swinton s canon

       "486  as the twin surfer dudes   stew and phil deedle   lay bandaged and unconscious in the hospital   phil comes to first and chooses the coolest way to wake his brother    yanking out his iv   he uses it like a water pistol to soak his brother s face    this bit of lame physical humor is typical of disney s meet the deedles   a movie more to be endured that watched       i stopped looking at my wife during the screening   since every time i did   she d start sticking her finger in her throat    and she s right   it is that bad      directed without any imagination by steve boyum   whose long background in film is mainly in stunts and in second unit direction   the film limps along at best    boyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts   stunts and more stunts    amazingly for someone with his background   he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones   and we have a car go off the road five different times    maybe more    but who s counting    and then there is the script by james herzfeld   whose only other film   tapeheads from a decade ago   was so awful that it is considered a cult classic    meet the deedles   however   is painfully bad rather than laughably bad    it will probably be in and out of the theaters like a tornado and is in no danger of becoming a classic anything    herzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes   your geyser s a geezer     and   i d like to put a deedle in her haystack      as the movie opens   the twins   who at one point describe themselves modestly as   a walking kodak moment     are celebrating their 18th birthday    as they ride a parasail high above the waters of waikiki   a truant officer pursues them on his jet ski    as heirs to the fabulous fortune of the deedle empire   the boys are sent by their father to camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform the two laid back beach bums into men    as they arrive in their wetsuits in yellowstone   they ve got their surfboards   skateboards   and a hawaiian drink machine the size of an armoire    their camp has gone out of business   but they are mistaken for new park rangers    the rest of the movie has them fighting the park s overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as a deranged ex ranger   played by dennis hopper   who is out to stop old faithful before its billionth birthday celebration   scheduled for later in the week    hopper   who has made some wonderful movies   carried away being a recent favorite   does have a propensity for choosing some truly odoriferous material    this isn t his worst acting   but meet the deedles is arguably the worst movie he s ever been in    steve van wormer and paul walker   as stew and phil   give lifeless performances    the only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is a cute little prairie dog named petey    even the cinematography by david hennings is so prosaic that it manages to make yellowstone look dull    to add insult to injury   hennings is fond of inappropriate close ups   which only serve to remind us of the inanity of the dialog    put a ten foot pair of lips on the screen   and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said    although boyum says in the notes that he is proud that his film is appropriate for families   one wonders how many skateboarders will attempt the movie s stunt of lying on your back on a skateboard while negotiating a busy and twisting mountain road    they make it look like so much fun that i m sure many will try some variation of the stunt       how could this possibly be worst     asks phil    just when you suspect it can t   the movie takes a turn further downhill    its low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag    after phil s girlfriend digs up a big mount of moist soil   they suck in a long worm    like the two dog lovers eating spaghetti in lady and the tramp   their lips finally meet in a kiss    as they pull back   their faces are full of the dirt that encased the worm they have just ingested    meet the deedles runs about an hour and a half    it is rated pg for a little bathroom humor and would be acceptable for kids around 6 and up    my son jeffrey and his friend nickolas   both almost 9   gave the show          they both thought the scenes with petey were among their favorites    nickolas also mentioned the scene in which the circus bear drives a jeep   and jeffrey especially liked the one in which the circus elephant was referred to as dumbo

       "487  have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally   at any given moment   in life    or if it is an occurrence that is predetermined by some much larger force within the world   or outside of it    these thought provoking questions are the subject of   final destination     which is the most riveting horror drama since 1999 s   the sixth sense      stylishly filmed and tautly directed by   x files   alum james wong   the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters   in accurately written   teen speak     rather than overwrought   highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldn t use     all the while developing into a darkly foreboding   severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the less successful   but still suspenseful epilogue    at the start of the film   17 year old high school senior alex browning   devon sawa   is about to leave with his 40 student french class for a field trip to paris    progressively getting a case of preflight jitters   he spots several mysterious   coincidences     including the departure time being 9   25   the same as his september 25 birthday   as well as hearing the john denver song   rocky mountain high   over the sound system in the airport bathroom       john denver died in a plane crash     alex grudgingly mutters to himself    once seated   alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff   and after causing a ruckus onboard   he   as well as six other students and a teacher   are thrown off    arguing in the airport lobby   alex s suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight   killing all 300  passengers   including the rest of their classmates    as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode   the fellow survivors   whom he has saved   treat him in varying manners    carter   kerr smith     the hotshot jock   holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate    alex s best friend   tod   chad e   donella     wants to stand by him but can t because of his fearful parents    the teacher   mrs   lewton   kristen cloke     is frightened by him   believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster   as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker    only outsider clear rivers   ali larter     who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alex s premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before   is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life    that is only the setup of   final destination     and the less said about what follows   the better    suffice to say   the film does   indeed   turn into a slasher film   albeit one that is more thoughtful than most   and replaces a knife wielding maniac for the never seen granddaddy killer of them all   the grim reaper itself    the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes   and   final destination   surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years    graphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner   they manage to occasionally be so intense you don t know whether to shrink down in your seat   tap your feet in nervousness   or turn away    devon sawa   a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 1999 s underseen slasher comedy     idle hands     is even more of a charismatic presence here    the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival   which he comes to believe he wasn t meant to do   as well as the loss of the other passengers   is superbly and subtly acted on his part    one scene   in which he is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful    ali larter   1999 s   varsity blues       in the other central role   is also effective   as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before   leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man  the exact opposite of her now deceased father    the other roles are not as fully written   and most remain rather one dimensional    the movie is mainly sawa s   however   and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles    tony todd   1992 s   candyman       as an arcane morgue attendant   pops up for a five minute cameo   but his appearance is rather supererogatory    and the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye   while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy    ultimately   what is so good about   final destination   is that   within the confines of the slasher genre   writer director wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner   and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frighten  two things that are rarely found in today s horror films    if anything   it s safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again

       "488  there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie    action movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences   while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full circle    for fans of both genres   however   realism is key    action fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic   and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie s end    on this advice   director john frankenheimer   the island of dr    moreau   strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller   ronin    the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing   considering the fare that s fallen into the same category over the last few years    the script   written by j   d   zeik in his big screen debut   approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission   impossible two years ago    a certain number of people will be lost by this   but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times    frankenheimer masters the script with poise   and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck    his ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here   and ronin becomes a better movie because of it    robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time    he takes command and offers much gravity as the ex spy sam   a man who s called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre   natascha mcelhone   recover a package    the package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast   especially once the requisite double crossing begins   and its role is skillfully penned by zeik    at times   however   zeik s tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission   impossible   de niro might easily become tom cruise   the package might become cruise s computer disk    fortunately   the focus here is almost entirely on the package   whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double cross and why it happened    the action content is impressive   and it lives up to the hints given in previews    the only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness    ronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish   but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots    the suspense tapers off considerably by the end   a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie s open    considering these factors it s good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well   and it s another good bet this month    since quality is usually sparse during the early fall months   it s definitely worth the visit

       "489  steve martin shines but sgt   bilko  fails to impress  based on the popular 50 s sitcom   sgt    bilko follows the string of old sitcoms to movie conversion fever    remember the brady bunch movie or the beverly hillbillies released sometime back       brady bunch was a moderate hit in in the us while hillbillies flopped      i do not really know whether the hollywood minds are running out of good ideas or just being plain lazy   but the tv conversion movies are hitting our screens like wildfire   sad to say   with mixed success    such movies are mostly targeted at us viewers since they are usually followings of such series over there and the larger the following   the more likely the sitcom will be made into a movie    sgt    bilko   frankly   i have not seen any its original tv version     even with the charm and wild antics of funnymen steve martin and dan akroyd   failed to entertain    sgt   ernest bilko is the man behind the motor pool   place of vehicle storage and repair   of fort baxter    though totally unskilled in the field of work that he is supposed to be in charge of   he has an almost superhuman ability and zeal to sniff out money making opportunities   from running a gambling den in the military garage to 4 d pools    though materialistic in mind   bilko s methods has thoughtfully  enriched  the lives of the men of fort baxter   providing them with some form of real recreation within the camp and the people love him for that    colonel hall runs the entire fort and thanks to his inborn  blissfully confused  state   bilko has managed to hide his operation   though nearly every living person in the fort knows about it    bilko s state of ascent is suddenly under fire when the pentagon sends major thorn   a tough cookie on army regulations   to check on the progress on the  70 million hovertank project   a new weapon under development within the fort s grounds    to add to his problems   thorn is determined to bring bilko down in retalliation of a major  sabo  done on him by bilko during their younger army days    director jonathan lynn   who directed my cousin vinny   in which marisa tomei won an oscar for best supporting actress   managed to pull sgt    bilko through with suitable pacing and some exceptional moments of laughter   but that is about it    there are really not enough laughter packed moments in sgt    bilko to fully entertain the average movie goer    still   steve martin s sgt    bilko is played with finesse and full force by the renowned comedian    without him   sgt    bilko would have just fell flat on its face    sgt    bilko did moderately well in the us box office early this year but i doubt it will earn much elsewhere around the world    the current trend in mixed successes in such tv conversions may be a blessing in disguise   really   at least it will force hollywood to re think any of its initial intentions to turn another tv idea into a movie or at the very least approach those ideas with more creativity    unless you are a fan of the tv series or love to watch steve martin in action   you can skip this one when deciding which movie to catch in the local theatres    i m sure there are better ones around

project  dogma     it might just be kevin s best work to date    it s very funny with smart and foul mouthed dialogue while unexpectedly it has a serious undertone to it and besides going against god and jesus christ   it actually tries to tell people that there is such a thing rather than that there isn t    in 1994 a little  27   000 movie premiered at sundance    this little film was called  clerks  and this little film went on to become a huge video sensation    you really can t meet a person on this green earth who has not seen  clerks     it was hailed by critics as one of the best movies of the year and soon a sequel is coming    in 1995 kevin made another movie  mallrats  that flopped horribly   thought it was not the best movie ever made it was a pretty good little flick    it was panned by critics but hailed by audiences and in 1997  chasing amy  came out and was kevin s biggest success to date    now in 1999 we get a great little movie by the name of  dogma     wow   what a cast    ok here is the plot in this movie   linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic    one day at her house metatron   the voice of god   appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels   matt damon and ben affleck   from getting back into heaven by ways of a church    ok now get this   she is told to find two prophets   one who talks a lot and one who doesn t   however she gets jay and silent bob instead   who give us great performances      now on her way to new jersey with jay and silent bob to try and stop the two angels the 13th apostle falls out of the sky   chris rock   and helps guide her to find these angels    salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way    azrael   jason lee   who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win    bethany   linda fiorentino   has to now use the help of all these people to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith    what a movie   it is everything rolled into one   an offensive   offbeat   smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end   and ends up being a feel good movie    who would have known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself    now for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart    yes it may target the catholic community and bash them a lot   but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven   it actually goes with god and kevin gives a message that there is a god    this review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie    kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie    of course the best   and funniest   of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob    probably the best characters in movies that i like    the star studded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin   jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while    the script was written by kevin smith with many f words in there of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what isn t and makes us laugh at the same time as we think    chris rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well   with some classic lines    linda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is    of course jason mewes and kevin smith do a great job as jay and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay   as well as silent bob      alan rickman   jason lee   salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon and ben affleck in the starring roles    being oscar winners for the classic  good will hunting  they give great performances here again but matt damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he could    ben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story    the movie s only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it    however the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members    dogma  stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to  clerks     while being funny at times   in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but can t deny it     dogma  will offend people   especially deeply religious people   but for those of you who are open minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you    all kevin smith fans must see

       "491     note   there are spoilers regarding the film s climax   the election   of course    we see matthew broderick   a man torn to a primal state   he s been unfaithful to his wife   lied to and manipulated his students   and by the same token they ve demeaned his masculinity   his self respect   his desperate attempt at changing the world    and yet   he equates the cause of his pain   his torment   with tracy flick   reese witherspoon      no matter how many students have come and gone   and disappointed him as an educator   she s the real threat    about to give in   and divulge that she s won by only a lone vote   broderick s mccalister turns in defeat   sees tracy s euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says    no     the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men   no matter how obscure   have in their relationships   a traditional expectation of success   to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry    she can t go higher than him    he won t allow it    and what s amazing about   election   is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor    early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically   and then sexually   involved with a now departed teacher    it s like payne and taylor   his co screenwriter   have taken tracy   a girl desperate for friendship   loyalty   and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers   that they found sitting at the teachers  lunch table more fitting   to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist    and it s amazing the compassion that we have   it seems so real to us   and not merely because it s happened before   splashed all over the front pages   but   because of the all around   nice   persona of these people   we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters    it s with mandy barnett s   if you ll be the teacher   playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most   a final   viscous injection of bittersweet irony    sexuality   though   is not the only basis for payne s satire   or its success    it also makes a telling point about politics   friendship   and class boundaries    satire is required   or ought to be   anyway   to take itself seriously   or act so   while the audience does not    it s a fine line to straddle   but some films ignore it altogether     drop dead gorgeous   leaps infuriatingly to mind      payne and taylor hit the right chord   their characters are real people   neither is perfect   but rather both of the leads are flawed   misguided individuals who retain   somewhat   noble intentions at heart    we sympathize with them   but still   as a satire   their idiosyncratic behavior   and their wrongdoing   is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle   but also reflect and meditate   about    minus half a point   though   for payne admitting not to having seen   ferris bueller s day off      whatever

       "492  running time approximately 1hr 40mins  reviewed by jack choo  rating    the movie starts with a rather se7en ish opening sequence   rather cool and sets the mood for things to come    the story propels the audience into a neo reality   somewhat very close to conscious reality but laced with weird tinges of blue and red    existenz is actually the name of a new virtual reality game    supposedly   vr games are highly popular as is considered a legal drug in this neo reality               leigh   is the ultimate game creator and introduces her ultimate game experience in the form of existenz    players are required to have bio ports embedded in their spine   which plugs to a game pod in order to enjoy the immersive experience    during a secretive beta testing cum teaser meeting for this new game   an assassination attempt on       life occurs and she runs off with fellow bodyguard         law             is more of a realists than anything else   afraid that he ll lose reality if he begin to play these games but       requires his help to immerse together with her into existenz to check if the program is still functioning properly after the assassination attempt    as they soon discover   they are transported between realities within existenz uncovering more than they initially expected    existenz has all the cronenberg gore that is expected of him    even so   this film is no where near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners    not even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful the fly    existenz can probably be looked upon as his 90 s version of videodrome   even so   it is a poor follow up    while in most of his famed films   his penchant for gore always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot    in existenz   the gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film and seem to be an act of over indulgence than anything else    jennifer jason leigh and jude law   both commendable actors   looked aloof and miss directed throughout the entire film    the scripting and acting barely pulls the film out of the b grade category    it was obvious that cronenberg worked on a really tight budget and it seems that he handled that pretty well in the production design and values created for this film   the opening sequence   though   probably formed a considerable portion of the budget      which is actually quite good    existenz is too predictable and cliched in these times    10 years ago   it would have been another classic for cronenberg    cronenberg fans however     those people who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation on film   should not give this film a miss as some form of appreciation can still be offered by you

       "493  a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets    the film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities    the result is merely an academic exercise   leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn t build on to show them as the poets they were    on paper   this shouldn t have been so terrible    it had a talented director in agnieszka holland     the secret garden       a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton   dangerous liaisons     and a capable cast    but the film was done in by its inept script   the unappealing way the film was directed   and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud    i found his performance to be the most risible one in the film   with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius   spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade    he   especially   looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be    but when the two of them were together   it looked like a mismatch    leonardo s rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude   yet we know from rimbaud s poetry   that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring    the film opens in post revolutionary france in 1871   the 16 year old rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems    he accepts verlaine s praises and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home   and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville    once there   rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household   has an immediate conflict with verlaine s busty 18 year old wife mathilde   romane     and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her family s money   even though he has nothing else in common with her    when verlaine states     poets can learn from one another     rimbaud replies in a haughty tone     only if they re bad poets      he will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship    verlaine proves to be weak willed   beating his wife regularly   and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud    when mathilde s father kicks rimbaud out of the house   verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the two become lovers    it s a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets   which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce    in brussels   verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail    while rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19    he instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and a gun runner   and after ten years there   comes home with a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of 37    the hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying    the film ends on a whimper       with  verlaine talking with rimbaud s sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses   which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published    this film was especially annoying because rimbaud s poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film   as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry    i have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film   but whatever it was   it just didn t work    it certainly didn t bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the so called father of modern poetry

       "494  i have never been a   star trek   fan   and   to tell the truth   out of the five films in the series that i have seen   1   2   3   8   9     i have disliked all of them    i do   however   always go into one of these with an open mind   and the ninth film in the series     star trek   insurrection     is no exception    dropping almost completely the hard core sci fi element of the previous one in the series     first contact       insurrection     tells the story of a planet that holds only 600 people   known as the ba ku   as well as the fountain of youth    at the start of the picture   the villagers go under attack by a second alien species   known as the son a   who want to push all of the ba ku out so that their own race will not die out    also attacking the ba ku is data   brent spiner     a robot from the star trek enterprise    after returning to jean luc picard   patrick stewart   and the gang on their space ship   no one can understand why data was somehow taken over by another force    so several of the star trek members travel down to the planet of the ba ku   where picard meets up and starts to fall in love with one of the inhabitants   a sultry   kind alien woman   donna murphy     who is over six hundred years old   but looks to only be in her thirties       star trek   insurrection     is a completely unoriginal and cheap looking installment in the series   and is a big step down from   1996 s   first contact     which at least appeared to try to make something a bit different    in     insurrection     however   it plays like a low rent episode of the television show   due to the small scale   generic storyline   and an emphasis on one liners rather than excitement    the film was filled with nearly non stop comedy   and worse yet   most of it fell flatter than a cartoon character that drops off a cliff    meanwhile   when there were action sequences   they were not at all interesting or inventive   relying on that old reliable ticking timer that counts down very   very slowly    this plot device   which is seen in just about every action film made nowadays   is getting old fast    are filmmakers so bankrupt of ingenuity and ideas that they must always have a timer ticking away during the climax    another element of     star trek     films in general is that picard seems to always have to have a love interest   but then she always miraculously disappears when the next film is made two or three years later    although donna murphy   who falls victim to this thankless love interest role here   is actually one of the few characters that we get to know in the 103 minute running time   alfre woodard was far superior in     first contact      she should have returned for this one   but i don t blame her for not wanting to waste her time with this movie s disappointing and often lifeless screenplay   by michael piller       star trek   insurrection     is perhaps the weakest film in the   star trek     series   although i have not seen what is widely considered the worst     star trek v   the final frontier         insurrection     is the type of   safe   sequel that will bewilder non fans   since it is so low tech compared to most of today s blockbuster action films   although most of these are honestly not very good   either     and should disappoint the loyal trekkies   since it could have easily been better if the makers had realized that the screenplay needed to go through a few more drafts    on second thought   they probably should have completely thrown the script out    that way   they could have come up with a story that at least had a sign of intelligence and freshness

       "495  the rocky horror picture show  special edition    1975    starring   tim curry and susan sarandon  cult films are never mainstream    the casual viewer of a cult film will look at it and be repulsed and confused   yelling out  what the hell is that        fans of these sorts of movies will be laughing at every other second at all the  hidden jokes  they missed the first time around while normal movie watchers will look at them like they re insane    the rocky horror picture show   recently re released in a  special edition  to video   is the mother of all cult films    period    like some other cult films   most notably little shop of horrors   the rocky horror picture show is a musical with a twisted edge to it    this movie begins out innocently enough  a couple get engaged at a friend s wedding and get a flat tire in the middle of the night while it s raining    they go to a castle to try to use the phone    little do they know that the castle is owned by dr   frank n   furter   a mad transexual transvestite scientist who has recently created a creature he will use for personal reasons    the acting is pretty good overall    tim curry   home alone 2   legend   is over the top as frank n   furter    it s interesting to see that this movie was one of future oscar winner susan sarandon s   dead man walking   first film  she plays janet   the girlfriend of brad majors    even the singer meatloaf is in it      the songs are all very good yet twisted in their own way    a sampling of titles range from damn it   janet to touch a touch a touch a touch me    all the actors sing their songs with no dubbing from other actors  kind of a bad thing    barry bostwick   brad majors   tries to sing as does susan sarandon   but tim curry is clearly the most professional having extensive stage experience    meatloaf sings like meatloaf    the new special edition contains two original movie trailers of the film as well as two songs deleted from the

       "496  okay   bear with me y all   cause first off i have to get this off my chest    what the hell is up with that damn crab        whew   okay    cause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end   as cute as the crab maybe    even i know that you need more footage than   that      and that wasn t the only thing getting on my nerves    the cutesy gimmicks   saccharine sweet score   soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar   as amanda   and sean patrick flannery   as tom   might have held some appeal during   oh   say the first 10 minutes of the movie    at first the movie moves along at a quick   interesting pace    it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street   whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just   doesn t   die    a ridiculous concept   yes   but at this point i m willing to accept it because i m willing to accept that this is how amanda s life is changed   how her powers are received    later on   the movie can t seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom    and this is why the clips of the crab were annoying   they weren t just repetitive   they were out of place and unnecessary    the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed   sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development   amanda suddenly becoming a great chef   her falling in love with tom   etc       sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good    some places the plot just doesn t make sense   sometimes it s way too contrived   the crab bit   for example     and sometimes too corny   peaches emitting dry ice    can t beat that      all in all the plot seemed fragmented   unconnected    not romantic at all   and only funny in some places    so   okay   do the magic powers come from the crab    or the fairy godfather    she can   float   now too    and all of a sudden   instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches   she can put her emotions into her food    tom all of a sudden just accepts amanda s   witchcraft   in the end    would people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupac s video    what the hell is up with that damn crab    it is unfortunate   because i liked the basic premise of the movie   until it became too fantastical and tiresome    the film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least   a   theme for a while   but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and 5 minutes of people crying at their tables    the humor was good in some places   nolan gets the funniest bits   including that incomprehensible   totally random thing with the dolls      gellar and flannery are qualified actors   and gellar has a particular charm   but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy   or even annette in the upcoming   cruel intentions     than this sorry excuse for a character    it s almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is   or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible    the supporting character nolan was a highlight   though he reminded me a bit of kevin in   you ve got mail     see footnotes      and   as always   typical of a chick flick   romantic comedy   there s a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background   cued up at all the right places    this sort of got on the nerves after a while   too       simply irresistible   is not hard to understand   light   funny in some places   and generally disappointing because it can t draw the line between romance and protracted sap   between humor and tired slapstick    and how could i refrain from making a pun                   simply irresistible   is all too easy to resist       first viewing   2 6 99       did anyone else think this was a tad bit similar to   you ve got mail     or   the shop around the corner        business rivals fall in love    female counterpart s business is in danger of being shut down    female as mother  like figure guiding her    the annoying   hysterical ex girlfriends       i  really  like sarah michelle gellar s wardrobe

       "497  bad   bad    bad    that one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls    if that summary isn t enough for you   how about t a   t a   t a    still haven t got the point    other than director russ meyer s predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore mentioned anatomical areas   there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie    that is the fact that it was co written by famed film critic roger ebert   who also was responsible for the screenplay    after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face    this movie stinks out loud    quite frankly   this movie deserves a    but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny    so i m giving it a    and maybe that is too generous    right from the opening credits   i knew that i had a class a bomb on my hands    not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting   but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform    i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening   it does get explained later   and as soon as the first scene is over   we cut to a completely unrelated scene    to be honest   as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was   i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film    with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film   it wouldn t have surprised me if the opening had never been explained    so what is this movie about    you ask    like it really matters    ok   here goes    this all girl band headed by kelly macnamara   dolly reed   and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry    once there   they do manage to find success   due as much to their hooters as anything else   it sure wasn t for their brutally bad singing voices     and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them    everything from big egos   to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral    there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure   but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing     from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here    other than the above mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have    the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts    mr   ebert has generously thrown in helpings of   hey man       dig   and my all time favorite      this is my happening   and it freaks me out      now i ask you   with lines like that how can you go wrong    ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue    maybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter    i don t know   but all the big words in the world wouldn t be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting    but the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie    i ve seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey    in fact   there is one scene    the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes    during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries    add to the directing and writing the music in this movie    i almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken   there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers    then we have the cast    first lets start david gurian who played harris   the manager of the band    this has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera    sadly   his acting doesn t come close to making up for his looks    if you have been following along up to this point   this shouldn t surprise you    meyer s stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets    dolly reed plays kelly   the leader of the band    and no surprise here   she was cast for her cup size   not her talents    and yes   she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents    sadly   her ass is almost as large as her chest    hey   it a sexist movie   so i m writing a sexist review    then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey   one of the other band members    this goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie    meyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all   but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all    sure russ   now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows    on the up side   she does have a fun lesbo scene    i sound like i m writing a review in a porn magazine    but hey   i ll admit it   the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked    and since that was a huge disappointment   i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey    the only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it    unless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too    and if you are thinking of checking it out for the double d s    you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet    this is a movie that should be avoided at all costs    an even better idea might be to require video stores to place a warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls    beware   this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense    proceed with extreme caution

       "498  roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton    this italian film star   best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther   has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust    but benigni s life is beautiful   la vita e bella   is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love   devotion and sacrifice    the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni s guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore    like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him   most notably the almost forgotten harry langdon   benigni s guido has a childlike innocence    he ignores the growing anti semitism of the fascist government    instead   guido ardently falls in love and persues dora   a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official    in benigni s tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate   yet slapstick   encounter    guido wins dora    they marry    fast forward about five years    guido   dora   and their 5 year old son   giosue     giorgio cantarini   are a happy family    guido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore    but racial and anti semitic tensions are on the rise in italy   and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities    the task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp    here   guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son   but to keep him from being exterminated    it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched    for the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror   the pain   the unimaginable suffering of a schindler s list    true   many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over   and most were not sent to the death camps   but to work camps where they were used as slave labor    unlike steven spielberg   benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust    his story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child    for guido   to save his son   transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game    giosue   must follow the rules without question to amass 1   000 points    the winner takes home a tank    therefore   guido tells him   he must remain hidden in the barracks    he cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him    guido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates    guido   lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners   instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive    throughout their imprisonment   guido s quick thinking continually keeps his son from harm s way    ultimately   the allies rescue the camp    in a poignant scene   giosue   comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound    the boy goes wide eyed with wonderment and delight   thinking he has won the game    the price for his victory is most high    benigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell   a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness    life is beautiful is a fantasy   a fable    it is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust    those who object to it are missing its point    and that is simply where there is hope   where there is life and where there is love   the spark of humanity will never be extinguished    committed to lifelong learning

       "499  after bloody clashes and independence won   lumumba refused to pander to the belgians   who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo    their officers   particularly general janssens   rudi delhem   in the force publique   the congo s army   caused rebellions   undermining lumumba   who was outraged at the rape and murder of belgian nationals    with unrest building   moise tshombe   pascal nzonzi   and the province of katanga   which contained 70 percent of the country s resources   proclaimed secession    lumumba replaced janssens   making mobutu a colonel   and went on a pacification  tour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu   maka kotto     but it was too late     when you want to drown a dog   you say it has rabies     prophesies lumumba of his own fate    peck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players   although they frequently succumb to cliche   particularly regarding lumumba s private life    peck s script illuminates bantu sayings like  the hand that gives   rules  when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador    peck s direction is less assured   with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television fare    he s served well   though   by his casting of ebouaney in the title role    ebouaney is dynamic   radiating his character s fierce passion for his people and his country    lumumba s intelligence and ability to strategize   even as he s cornered by insurmountable odds   are given life by ebouaney    peck s subject and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production       lumumba   is a story that deserves to be told and ebouaney s performance makes the tragedy personally felt
